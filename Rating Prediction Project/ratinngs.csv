Office PREINSTTALLED , Slim and light

Looks very lovely etc. It means almost
everything is good at this range.
Cons - slight heating after hour's of work",32,5
Amazing package at this cost!!,"CONS:
Low sound from speakers, but i mostly use earphones so that’s not a problem for me.

PROS :
After Apple, it has the best track pad.

It’s finger print sensor beats Apple as well.

720MP camera is far more decent that HP’s HD camera.

Love the chiclet keyboard and backlit feature has been a big fulfilling need.

Battery backup is the best thing i feel in this.
I used multiple tabs for browsing and played online training videos for avg of 4 hours daily. Once when charged in the morning, i leave it on & connected to wifi throughout the day and it still shows 1 hours of more charge at the end of the day.",26,5
Xiaomi is going to catch the market,"Hi Guys, From the user experience, It has excellent build quality, Light weight, Finger print sensor is very quick, Backlit keyboard is awesome, Extremely superb. I brought i5 16gb variant for programming. Its a perfect windows macbook edition.",27,5
Buy it without having second thought.,"All the pros just one cons 'the speaker'.
No other brands are providing such value for money ultrabook.
Plz Buy 16gb ram as it is non-upgradable.
Buy mi notebook pro (14inches) if your primary requirment is for work/school/college.
Otherwise Buy mi notebook ultra (15.6inches).
(If you wanna spend 60k and you are confused to choose between mi notebook pro 16gb or mi notebook ultra 8gb, just go for 16gb..... But you can also choose mi notebook ultra 16gb by paying 64k.",25,5
Best laptop for the money spent,"Just got this laptop today, so based on just a few hours of usage.
Earlier using Lenovo Yoga 510 with touch and 360 degree rotation, but I havnt used these features much.

Needed a sturdy laptop, with latest specs, great display and for personal use, and as a backup if my office laptop dies on suddenly, but main purpose was entertainment, personal document work, photo editing as I am a photography enthusiast. Display was very important for me.

(Update 17/9/21: There are ways to calibrate the display, built in the laptop itself, to some extent and this is awesome. I was able to tweak the display fairly close to printing colors, all ok now)-----This department still I feel a bit short on my expectation, as it has 100% sRGB and 2k resolution. Sure its crisp and bright and way better then any mainstream laptop display, but colors are not accurate(100% sRGB means it can display all the colors in that space, but it doesn't claim or deliver accurate display). There is a lot of difference between pics edited on this computer and the prints I take on my sRGB space printer, even more so than my previous 5 year old lenovo with Full HD IPS display. I would test this out more and update. So not a replacement of a proper color accurate display. On the other hand, colors do not feel as punchy for watching movies etc, but not a big deal for me. Display for any other task is good enough, very sharp and much brighter than other laptops in the market. I am not disappointed, but not impressed based on what my usage is.

Please bear in mind this is a special requirement, 99.99% people would be amazed with the display quality, as this was amazing for day to day usage. Just not for critical work, and for the price I dont think anything comes close.(see update above)

As far as other things go, performance, boot times, finger print, typing on keyboard, look and feel are all great. Seems sturdy, so should be good for a long time. This laptop is also not for gamers, as I feel performance for very heavy games and other tasks a little short, people need for video editing should spend some more for the i7 version or better assemble a desktop if mobility is not absolutely a necessity. Mine is i5 16gb which is good enough for me. Battery life is good for 8 hours of light work.

Overall, for the price, and considering all metal build and performance it offers, this is a great buy. Just see your use case, take sometime to review your own requirements, and then consider. As a day to day laptop, I dont see anyone would find any shortcoming with this laptop. Its fine in all the departments.",22,5
Awesome,"Great laptop, great battery, display and processor all are performing awesome. 16 gb ram is more than enough, just go for it. Value for money.",23,5
Best in the budget!!,Happy with the product!!,24,5
Best for the price," This is the best laptop one can buy in this price range
I will divide this review into pros and cons.
Cons: 1. It has a soldered ram so it would not be possible for the end user to upgrade it if you need more ram then you have to go for the 16 gb version .
2. Lack of an sd card reader.
3. The sound quality of the speaker is not that great.( It's not very loud .)
Other than that I couldn't find any other con in this device in the past 3 days of usage
Pros: 1: Amazing display.This display is way better than realme notebook display .For comparison 2.5k vs 2k also it comes with 100%srgb so it's colour accurate.
2:Most devices in this price range(including realme notebook) come with the core i5 G7 series processor .But this one has the H series processor which was released in January .The H series processor has a better single core and multi core performance.Also the integrated iris xe graphics is great .
3:This device doesn't lag in day to day usage and does a good job in heavy tasks such as video editing .In my case while I was editing a video I didn't notice any lag and the fan also did not kick on.
4: Xiaomi claims 12 hrs of battery life but in real life usage for web browsing and online classes of about 2 hrs you will get 6 to 7 hrs of battery backup and for heavy tasks you can expect 4 to 5 hrs of battery backup.
5.This laptop has the best built quality in a laptop in this price rang .It's the same as a macbook pro .
6:Pre installed Ms office 2019 is amazing.
7:Backlit keyboard ,charging via thunderbolt and fingerprint scanner ,wifi 6 and a huge trackpad are just amazing.
This laptop has everything a cse student needs.And I hope it lasts long. Also if you are planning to buy extended warranty then buy this laptop from mi.com with the extended warranty since the cost of extended warranty in their website and app is 3500 rps for 2 years.I bought it from Amazon so i had to buy the extended warranty seperately for which they charged me 5500 rps for 2years. Thank you.",298,4
Is this worth it? A thought on budget,"I'm not going to give you the specs or list down pros and cons. It's obvious now.

The thing I'm concerned is the price and it's worthiness.

Is this budget friendly?
Maybe or maybe not.
It cost me my dad's two month salary. Thanks to his early savings, we are not drowning.
So in my case, it's not or to anyone who falling on bottom line of middle class. I picked this particular one after obsessively searching and evaluating the prices of different laptops over the span of last eleven months.

Initially, I had my eyes on MSI Modern 14(Ryzen 4500u). Solid specs at that 49-54k price range. I hesitated because of the brand MSI(same can be said for MI but I will still choose it over MSI). Ram was 8gb, though I believe upgradeable but never made it clear. And then came the Windows 11 update and that model was not listed for the upgrade. So it gave me one more reason not opt to for it.

Another laptop, I might have bought, would have been Dell Inspiron 14 Ryzen 5500u, which was around 55k in the first month and when I finally decided to throw my money, they increased priced by 2 more thousands. I don't know what it's priced at now. Worth looking over, if you are ok with 45% ntsc display and ram is 8gb but ram is upgradeable.

If not this MI notebook, for now, I surely would have bought, Lenovo Thinkpad E14 AMD gen3. Fully upgradeable. Starting from around 53-55k. You can basically choose from screen to battery. Before buying it, don't forget to look for Lenovo coupon. They can give you discount up to 3k. If you don't find any, use LENGOD. I think it always works. Gives you an instant discount of 1500 rupees.

So, I still bought this MI notebook. I never bought any MI products and hate their buggy ad loaded phones. And worst, their previous year MI notebook.

I bought this laptop because it looked very promising of all out there. So far(I have been using it for last 4 days), I did not feel like I burned my money for nothing. Except battery which is...meh and the keyboard worries me, because I'm not a delicate typist. I have always typed on cheap keyboards, so I type monstrously without much care.

I would be using this laptop, mostly for programming. My tech stack is quite lightweight. React and Node(so far, it's been proved much snappier than my old computer). Though, I have planned to try Android next year. Other than that, I use chrome(which pretty easily eat up the ram), pdf reading, writing docs sometimes and nothing much fancier like video editing or gaming.

Is this worth it?

For me, it's probably have been much worthier if they have given two year warranty. As MI is fairly new I laptop market and I have bought this laptop at a great risk.

Should you buy this?
If you can wait, then wait for few more months and do your research and keep yours eyes open. We don't know for how long will this laptop will last. That's only been my concern. Rest is good. Probably the best you can find in the market right now.

I would update this review in upcoming months, if find any flaw or anything specific.",116,4

"Good, but can be better"," I’m coming from a MacBook Pro that I use for work. I’m planning on starting my own business and wanted a laptop that could crush office work. These are my thoughts from 1 day on this laptop:

Screen: Definitely a highlight of this device. Bright, Vivid and great contrast with deep blacks (deeper than my MacBook)

Sound: Nothing can beat Apple in terms of sound quality and loudness, this is still manageable if you are not in a noisy environment

Keyboard: Very similar feel and travel compared to the MacBook, I’m able to type and hit combos with ease

Trackpad: Responsiveness to touch us comparable to MacBook, but the click is really poor. It needs a huge amount of pressure compared to the MacBook

Performance: On Par with the MacBook in terms of heating and speed, haven’t noticed connectivity drops or flickering or intense heating. It does heat, but so do MacBooks running on Intel Chips

Webcam: Another area where it absolutely outshines a MacBook Pro. It’s not the absolute best quality but it’s more manageable than what I have on my MacBook

Final Recommendation (will update as I find more): Great buy for productivity, but I would advise purchasing an additional mouse because the click is really bugging me",18,4
Overall Awesome Product,"This is My 4 Days Review About This Product

After using for 35 days,"I bought Mi Notebook Pro i711th gen and 16gb Ram.

1.Battery (3/5)
Full charge will give only 5.5hrs (I have used my laptop only for browsing, YouTube, few apps in background ) and It will take around 1hour 30 mins for charging from 20%to 95%.[ ASUS laptops in this price range will give better power backup around 7hrs.]

2.Heat Management (2/5)
May be because of bad design(battery is placed below near keyboard) we can feel heat when we use upper keys of keyboard.

3.Charger (3/5)
Charger is Type C , many people are complaining about charger is heating very much, but in my opinion all Type C laptop chargers will have this issue.

4.Weight (3.5/5)
Mi note book pro weight is 1.4kgs, but u feel like it is around 2.2kgs in hand may be due bad weight distribution (ASUS laptops in this price range have better weight distribution so we can feel only 1.4kg)

Except above issues, i found Mi Notebook pro is excellent in other aspects like
1.Performance (5/5)
2.Display(5/5)
3.WIFI connectivity(5/5)
4.Build Quality(5/5)

[Don't buy this laptop for GAMING. It is not a gaming laptop]",16,4
Product is definitely best except for the speaker,"Today I got my product delivered and I m very happy to use it it has very good battery backup, premium look only thing missing was a good quality speaker",22,4
Best in range!,"Well after a long thought-fight with self, I finally went for it and I am glad I did so 😅

Short answer: As mentioned in tittle, ""Best in this range"".
Go for 16gb varient if you are into multitasking and 8gb if you are in looking a decent laptop for basic entertainment and goto tasks.

Long answer:
Look and build : 5/5
Screen quality: 4/5
Performance: 4/5 (I am able to run 4 code editor instances, 2 browsers with 10+tabs and a couple of other programs without any hiccups)
Battery: 4/5 (So far good)
Sound: 3/5 Could have been better but if you use headphones no worries and I am totally ok with it. (It's not a audio player to be Frank so no need to complain about it. 😅)

Overall: A Good poweful and affordable laptop!

Plus, don't think about the Soldered RAM unless you are extremely sure that you will need more for your work or you wish to absolutely upgrade in future. 16gb is more than sufficient!

Thanks Amazon!

I'll update this post after a couple of months post usage.",2,4
Great value for money. Modern and solid build.,"I'm using i7 16GB variant. I love the display, keyboard. I can turn on and login into windows within 10s. I bought this only for coding so I haven't played any games. Not yet.

For those who are looking for thin, modernish, light weight laptop go for this machine. It is powerful enough to handle Android Studio. Don't go for 8GB, because after opening few chrome tabs and code editors my RAM was like 8GB occupied. So definitely go for 16GB model if you do multiprocessing.

They claimed we can get 11hrs out of the battery but honestly the maximum I got is 6.5hrs when coding in simple editors like VS Code.

The speaker is horrible. I cannot listen to anything. I always have to use earphones. That's the biggest cons. Everything else is great about this laptop.

The device is eligible to run Windows 11. I haven't tried the beta because I read the windows explorer is still slow in beta and Android Subsystem for Windows is yet to arrive on Windows 11.",3,4
A bit above average.,"Have been using the laptop for nearly 6 months now. Here is my take:

Pros:
1) Great screen, images are crisp and colorful. Decent even for outdoor working.
2) Sturdy form-factor. Despite of being light weight it feels solidly built. Plus the one finger lid open is cool.
3) Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are stable too.
4) Finger print recognition is on the power button (sensible design) and works quite well.
5) Good assortment of connectivity ports.
6) Efficient start-up time.

Cons:
1) Very poor speaker output, you will struggle to hear a word especially if you have a fan switch-on in the room. You would definitely require a external speaker for multimedia.
2) The track-pad is just not good. Not very accurate, unwanted gesture recognition and all in all irritating to work with. Ideally you would be using a external mouse for work.
3) The metal body does retain some static charge while charging. Although very minor but it still does.

Acceptable:
1) The keyboard is decent enough for work. Although personally hate the miniaturized Up/Down arrows. Also not a fan of the positioning of the CTRL and Fn keys, frequently miss click them. Back-lighting is also good enough.
2) Battery charge last for a decent 6 hours in above moderate usage. Also doesn't get scorching hot ever on high utilization.
3) Decent value for money, not the best but good enough for under 60k with the i5+16gb version.
4) Web cam is not very good, but okayish for normal work calls.",One,4
Overall ok laptop and priced on a higher side,"I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5.

Now why 3.5 stars:
1. The edges to open lid with single hand are super sharp one can get easily scratched.
2. Super con - no grip. Seriously MI forgot to put grip below laptop. It doesn't stick to the table and slide like seesaw.
3. Speakers are poor
4. No camera shutter for privacy and yes camera is of poor quality doesn't even feel like 720p
5. Thermal go high on and above keyboard area while charging
6. Type C charge provide is of super cheap quality - utter cost cutting. Definately one need to spend 2k just after a year or so because its not going to last long
7. No idea about after sale service
8. 16:10 is just gimmick - ran Sheehan on amazon prime the video filled 50% portion of the screen and rest was black

After using it for few days I feel this laptop 16GB+I5 is bit highly priced. It should be somewhere between 50-55k not more than that. Come on MI you are not a well established brand in laptop world like hp or dell, you should have atleast provided an aggressive pricing.

So to conclude it finally, if you can live with above cons go ahead and buy it. It will serve your purpose for next 4-5yrs",482,3
"Just because it has a silver metallic, do not think this is equivalent to a MacBook","So, let’s talk about good things first.

Display: Yes, it has a QHD display in 16:10 aspect ratio (roughly, the actual ratio is bit less tall) and the display quality is really god at this range or even at range of 1.5 Lakhs. The screen is not exactly matte, but does good job of dimming down reflections. Still, not suggested to take it out in the sun as the nit count is low and the screen does reflect a bit.

Build quality: Real metal, not a finger print magnet. Solid construction, almost zero keyboard and screen flex. I have not dropped it yet, but, I am sure it can handle one or two low height drops (when lid is closed).

Keyboard: Not Apple’s magic keyboard or a normal mechanical keyboard comfort, but the key travel is good and not a pain to type on. The keys are responsive and are easy to press due to to aforementioned zero flex chassis.

Sound: Almost all reviews I have seen of this laptop, along with a friend who bought this before me, complained that the speakers are trash and sound is really bad. However this is not the case. Sound is good in clarity and volume (for the price range), but since these are down firing speakers, they do get muffled for those people who place the laptop on bed, tummy or on some dining table with a table cloth. Of course, you cannot host a party with these speakers, but if you have normal environment with no loud noises around, you can rely on the speakers and enjoy music and movies. Also, please do not expect bass from laptop speakers.

Heating: I did not encounter any heating issues with this laptop even when I tried to put some load on it. I avoid using the laptop for anything heavy due to battery issues, so could not test heating a lot.

Now, onto the things which you should know before you regret buying this laptop:

Battery: Absolutely pathetic. Takes forever to charge with the charger that comes with the unit and about 2 hours to go from 10% to 100% using a 65w USB ASUS USB C charger I have. Battery drain so quick that it surprises me. 100% to 10% in less than 5 hours with very minimal use - no games, no videos, just web browsing (some Youtube, but no other streaming). I also tried charging the laptop to 100% and just keep the display on and done nothing on it. Battery down to 8% in 5.5 hour.

Size: It is a compact laptop, yes but it is big for a 14incher. This is because Xiaomi tried to be Apple and added big trackpad (which is not so responsive in the corners, so acts like a small trackpad anyway), and blank empty areas next to keyboard (which Apple uses for upward firing speakers). Using this on the lap or on the go is not difficult but a standard 14 inch laptop should be atleast 20% smaller than this. If I need big laptops, I can get a 15 inch screen on the same chassis.

Bluetooth: If anyone reading this ever had the original Mac Mini, you would know it had issues with Bluetooth connectivity due to all metal body. Same here. I have 4 wireless bluetooth headphones ranging from budget to premium ones. All of them has connectivity issues with this laptop. I tried connecting an external bluetooth dongle to the laptop, and that worked fine.

I/O: I will not get into details, but do keep in mind that only 1 USB port allows for display out and HDMI is only 4K@30Hz. Also, the transfer speed is not same or stable on either of the USB-C Thunderbolt ports.

Gaming: LOL. Gaming at this price point with Intel Iris? Come on, stick to mobile gaming.",One,3
Above average product with cost cutting here and there,"Going by specs sheet it appears wow...
But things that should be considered which hampers your user experience:
1. Speaker output is useless and almost non existent under some normal scenerios like fan noise also
2. Quality of trackpad offered is just average...it is plastic and the buttons need to be pressed very hard which is non reassuring for long term use
3. The plastic used in connectivity ports gives less confidence while pluging and unplugging as it appears easily breakable
4. PD charger should have been offered instead of a generic one...you have to buy it from outside or carry around that brick cable with you
4. Software offered by MI is bearbone...dosnt feel a customised experience
5. Single fan can be a problem on heavly usage and the casing gets warm
6. Driver clash always occurs while opening widgets in Windows 11 and it crashes...have to disable Intel drivers to use widgets
7. Camera quality offered is just average looking at the overall specs",One,3
display bezel strip of cheap quality,"laptop internals are good, but when we talk about build quality only metal body of laptop is good.
keyboard, trackpad and display bezel strip are of bad quality. Trackpad looks very cheap as compare to the price segment. In short only internals and metal body is up to the mark thats it.",5,3
Body gets Power Earthing while Charging,"Initially after opening my new mi notebook pro laptop I plugged in the charging. After that tried to slightly rub on the body then i noticed that body getting Earthing like little bit of power supply. It is not much but in future it might effect internally.
I don't know whether it is happening with my laptop only or with every laptop that company providing.

Just Ok Product,"Looks good like mac book. Performance is average. Screen sharpness is good but Screen some times flickers in excel application while scrolling, Track pad is smooth like macbook but size is too large compared to is overall size.

Complained to Amazon but no use.",Helpful,3
Sort of value for money,"1. Since had initial bugs like macro key not working with later updates it was fixed

"Good in speed, bad for hours of use and trackpad",Screen is qhd but you can not use it for long duration of time continuously and it causes eye strain. Keyboard is good.

Not Up to the Mark As Marketed Youtube Review made us fool,"Having Huge trackpad with pathetic operational feedback is of no use. With Microsoft 2021 office it lags and sometimes freezs while purforming very basic task like lookup or match and index. what is the use of having that fast 11th zen I5 16GB RAM and Fast SSD as they calls it. the bundled charger is one of it's kind and its no one mentined that what sort of type C charger it will support.

keyboard Like page up and own Enter are all place such nicely that you would struggle to find it and use it. no scroll lock switch and this make it impossible to work fast with some programme like Excell Moving between sheets with keyboard is not possible in the first place.

For those who want to but this product.,"At first everything was good.
Laptop was good
Built - premium 5/5
Screen - Premium 5/5
But the issues starts afterwards
On the second day after my purchase I start seeing
That screen of my laptop goes dark or complete blank for 2-3 second more like it blinks for 2-3 seconds and I thought it was a system glitch so I ignored it. I barely used my laptop for 2 hours thorought the whole day.
But on the third day 11 December I was watching a movie and again it start happening but this time it start happening frequently like after every 10 min.
And duration of the black flashing or blinking sums upto 5-6 sec.
I checked everything. Drivers was up-to-date, everything was up to date. It was not an software issue. Maybe some wire or cable which is connected to the screen is damaged and is getting worse if I continue to use it because the screen blacking out time and how often it goes black is increasing.
I am devastated right now.
So I make a replacement call. Mr. Rahman was on the other end of the call and he get me a replacement unit but the catch was I have to wait for almost month to get it replaced because they are now out of stock he said.

Bad cooling!!!,"I bought this laptop from mi showroom. The cpu throttles even under light load. Can't compile without throttling. Can't even play old legacy titles without throttling and stutter. The cooling is inadequate. The bios is useless with only basic options. There is no way to see and adjust fan speed. No way to control cpu power limit or undervolt since intel disabled it. I searched for return policy for products purchased from offline stores, but couldn't find any, is anybody is aware of the details? But the build quality and screen is the best for this price range, but it's useless if the perfomance cannot match. Xiaomi laptops are only offering good hardware and are not very mature in the software/bios front. If you want a laptop for light home use buy this, for good performance look somewhere else.

I requested them to replace since it is just 15 days , but not response. Still I am waiting for their response. MI should think to upgrade their service they made good machine but it is useless if you cann't support even for manufacturing defects. AMAZON, I have been using your platform from last 5-6 years. I use buy almost everything that i need from Amazon but this time I am upset, Why do you tieup with such companies who doesn't have proper Support System for such high value items.

When I opened the laptop and powered on. It was heartbreaking to see Vertical lines on the display, I thought it's a resolution problem in the welcome screen and continued to the desktop screen. The lines remained. With a like touch on the lower bezel, the lines intensified.

Though the packing was good, I belive it must have got damaged in the transit.

Luckily I was able to raise a return request, since I found the issue within 5 min of delivery.

The purpose of the compact light weight laptop is portability, it makes me think if I made a wrong choice, what it the screen gets damaged while traveling after a couple of weeks. Then am out of return window.

In my opinion is better to wait for a couple of months to get feedback from users before buying.

I appreciate Amazon's quick delivery and replacement/return option.

Problem starts when the school is opened. When I tried to connect it withe projector fitted on ceiling through hdmi cable, the display is not working either in the laptop or through the projector.

Contacted the customer care as I have purchased premium care for 3 years. They contacted me online on the very next day.

On the third day I got an email that the case is closed as they couldn't connect to me.. They are not providing onsite support even when I have purchased their PREMIUM CARE PACK..

Pros:
SSD laptop, so high speed performance.
Booting time less than 15 seconds.
Anti glare screen. So no eye strain after long online classes, particularly good for kids.
Multi tasking working fine.
No lagging found while surfing, attending online classes, working with acrobat, word, excel, powerpoint...
Battery backup excellent, almost 6 hours nonstop usage....

Cons:
Camera quality average, but ok for online classes and meeting.
Have to buy external hdd, since it has only 195 gb available space...
Due to processor, high end gaming not possible.

Don't worry about basic processor Like Intel celeron. SSD did all. Fast and smooth. U can shutdown and ON your laptop within 10 second. Restart time arround 7 second.

#Touchpad feels premium.
#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.

The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.

Superfast booting and shut down speed. Extra wide screen, well placed key board, biggest mousepad, separate number pad on right side, fingerprint sensor. What more you want! Integrated Graphics card is giving desired output with speed. All branded components, with no frills.
Speakers are giving crystal clear sounds.

Nice Product 🎉🎉,"I'm using this laptop since 4 months. My experience with it has been very satisfying. First of all, would like to say thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and good packaging. Coming to the laptop, it is a good laptop.
The screen is good, clarity is nice despite HD only resolution. The speakers sound loud and with audio enhancement inbuilt, the sound is crisp. Ideal for watching movies. It is running Celeron processor which is meant for basic tasks but surprisingly coupled with 256GB SSD, normal tasks such as browsing, reading, document editing with Office feels smooth. But remember it isn't for gaming or heavy tasks. Battery life been great due to power efficient Celeron processor. Earlier I used Core i5 10th gen, although it was powerful but battery life wasn't that great. My usage is light with some browsing, content consumption and editing documents which this laptop serves without breaking a sweat. The fingerprint scanner is nice addition which I find very useful. No need to input pin everytime to unlock. Scanner response is pretty good. Front camera is okay if there's sufficient light in the room as you'd find in this budget. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.",13,5
Just go for it !!,"Thin and light but delicate too. Bought it for 23K, so bit pricy. As Win10 has Windows Defender, no need for redundant Antivirus program. So uninstalled McAFee as it slows down entry level systems. Uninstalled Microsoft Office 365 trial copy and installed MS Office 2010. The system is working fine and smooth for daily works like Web browsing, MS Office etc.
P.S It seems this model with Celeron 4020 is putup for sale since May '21, and hence old reviews here are for earlier model GQ329 with Celeron 3350 processor. The discontinued model was sold at around ₹ 18 to 20K it seems.",7,5

Worst Customer service from the Asus Company,"Best upgradation for your slow machine. Cheapest 3D nand ssd with great performance. It really makes a hell lot of difference to bump up the speed of your machine.

Got Sratched Laptop,"So my (2014 made) Asus laptop has a Intel Celeron 1007U @1.5Ghz, 2GB DDR3 RAM and a 500GB HDD. It had Windows 7 by the time I bought it then I updated it to Windows 10. That's where the problem started. Booting up took ~5 min, chrome took more than a minute to open and so on. Then I bought this one(250GB SSD) and copied the HDD data to it. Now I have a new laptop that can outperform some of the new ones sold today.
First thing is everything is fast from booting up to apps and everything.
Second the HDD took the strain off of RAM. With HDD just desktop alone took 1.7 GB of RAM. But now even apps don't take that much.
This machine is as fast as my work machine 10th Gen i5 2.5Gh 8GB DDR4 memory, 256GB SSD.
How? Since OS and apps migrate to storage from RAM after booting up it translates to faster storage, faster everything.
# # # Important thing to remember # # #
If you are a person who copies GBs of data to and from SSD please buy MX series coz it has the have DRAM built in.
DRAM is needed so that the SSD wares out evenly else you risk killing your SSD by uneven wear.
Yes it is ₹700 more but coz of DRAM it comes with 5year warranty instead of 3.
If you are normal user who just does some browsing office/ school work this(BX series) is more than enough.

3. My battery backup has improved. Earlier i was getting only 20 mins and i was considering replacing battery. Now i am getting over 1 hour easily. It covers my needs.
4. Easy to install. I just saw youtube videos and just did it myself. I had asked a laptop repair guy who said it will cost 3.5-4k. So basically i saved money also. Thanks to youtube.
5. I also installed the old 1TB HDD in a caddy by replacing CD rom, which was anyways not working and these days its obsolete. So basically now i have extra 1Tb storage also for storing any extra movies etc.

It was the best decision i took. It works as good as a new laptop. If i hadnt tried replacing SSD then i would have spent much more on a new laptop.",5,1
Affordable but not worth!!," I got the delivery a day before scheduled. The delivery boy was a nice person.

Not talking about the product the bx500 SSD is very light weight compared to as to my old hard disk my old hard disk was not working properly so I thought to replace it with and a new SSD.the installation of SSD was quite easy after installing the SSD in my laptop laptop performance got boost you can see the the boot time in the given video it's nearly as 13 to 15 seconds.I found a big difference in the performance which was before and after installing this SSD. I got this SSD for rupees 2499 which I think is worth the money. If you want to buy an SSD for cheap then go for it because BX 500 comes with 3D technology with boost up the SSD performance and hence it is faster than another simple SSD but not much faster than high and SSD such as Samsung 860 EVO or 860 Pro but the difference is not much. Thank you for reading my review and thank you Amazon for getting me a good product",3,1
Cheapest 3D NAND based SSD,"I used this to replace a 320GB HDD of my older Sony Vaio laptop. I didn't need much storage, but speed. And it has made the old laptop like lightening fast!!
I had lost interest in using the laptop, though it's a beautiful piece, due to speed problems. Instead I was using my new hp laptop mostly. After changing the drive, it totally revived my love for the Vaio. Now I can't look at the hp laptop, leaving this Vaio beauty!! ☺️
The cloning software for Crucial is also super easy, no trouble there in installation and cloning.
Great drive, value for money!",49,5
Why do I need an SSD? I'll tell you why.,"Posting updated review after
5 days usage.
Product delivered one day b4 due date. Installation was very easy, did a fresh installation of windows 10 and activated it. My system config is --
1. Intel core 2 quad Q9400
2. 4GB ddr2 ram
3. Gigabyte G31M ES2L mobo
4. 320GB WD Blue HDD
And now 240GB SSD.
5. 1GB AMD radeon graphics
Only thing is that my system has Sata 2 interface which is causing bottleneck for ssd. But I don't play games or do heavy tasks on my system so for me Sata2 is not a big deal. Till now didn't enabled momentum cache so can't say about that. I will do a speed test with and without momentum cache enabled and update my review again after some days of usage.

Update on 13/8/20.
Till now everything good but at first time I was little worried as the drive temps. reached apprx 66° during windows installation.
So crucial storage executive displayed warning about drive heating. Later found out ssds usually gets hot on continuous usage so install it in a place with proper ventilation and air flow.
Crucial website states if drive temps cross 70° then warrants gets void.
Now my drive usually gets upto max 62° but then cools down to 55-56° avg temp remains around 58°.
Regarding momentum cache I didnt notice any difference in daily usage but it works best with system with min 8GB RAM. As less data is written on ssd which increases ssd life.",22,5
Must upgrade for a older laptop ... Feel lile new,"If there was a way to give 6 stars I would have given it.

I was about to press the buy button for a new laptop when Amazon's AI engine threw this up and luckily I went through user reviews and crucial's website. I have a 4 year old dell inspiron 5000 series which has been giving a lot of pain in booting up and opening applications and sometimes even simple websites. I doubled the RAM from crucial itself an year back but it could help only marginally, however SSD updgrade has only one word which can describe the new experience - magic! My laptop is now blazingly fast, almost as fast as my swanky new office HP Ultrabook which is also SSD.
My suggestion is to go for this 1TB upgrade instead of 500GB as there is only a 3k difference in price but it will go a long way in ensuring you don't need any more upgrades. A word of caution that you will have to buy a USB to SATA connector for cloning the hard disk which is also available on amazon. Entire process of cloning and upgrading is very well explained on Crucial's website and anyone with basic knowledge can do it himself.
My only regret is that why didn't I upgrade earlier, it simply makes your old laptop fly and in my case also saved me from spending 60k on a new one.",35,5
The best decision of my life,"I must thank all the reviewers for sharing their experiences and making me confident enough to give it a try .

Though my system is only 2 years old, (win 10, i7, 8gb ram, 1 TB hdd) due to lot of applications installed system was responding very slow and lagging most of the time. So definitely I dint want to do a fresh installation as I dint want to install all those applications and OS again. Almost 90 % of my 1 TB harddisk was free.
I was skeptical about the hard disk upgrade including cloning as I was going to do all of these for the first time, including to learn how to open the laptop etc. I did some googling and got some idea about it. Also came across a free cloning software AOMEI Backupper, which worked perfectly at the first instance.

To my surprise it worked fine and now I have a super fast machine, without any need to reinstall any os/applications. Thank God.

I would recommend you to go for it without a second thought.",6,5
Worth Buying it.,"Initial booting or updating Windows was too sluggish & irritating, sometimes I surrendered my important tasks and windows took almost 10- 12 hours to install updates on originally installed hdd, processing of tasks was also very slow...

It has been got installed by the expert who maintains my pc & laptop regularly, I didn't thought to replace it by myself, because all this work should be done by a learned executive only. Doing it ownself, if not acquainted with complete procedure for replacement of hdd & reinstalling windows etc. could be detrimental to the pc or laptop etc...

I am quite happy to observe that, now, booting is instantaneous, windows updates are also getting installed within minutes (not hours) after getting replaced hdd with this SSD, though all my data has been stored on it as it was on hdd..

Price has become secondary to point out, yet it is quite reasonable at this point..

Thanks to Crucial & thanks to Amazon...",11,5
Perfect!,"I have attached screenshots of the CrystalDiskMark benchmarks. This is a review for the BX500 240GB variant. Have labelled the screenshots so that you can tell which one is from the enclosure and the laptop. The enclosure used was the Transparent Orico SATA to USB enclosure that supports UASP. Tested in the enclosure first just to be sure that the SSD was functioning before I put it in the laptop. I had doubts as the SSD box was bent and the SSD was curved as there wasn't any protective packaging. Fortunately it was working fine.

The laptop used to take a minute or more to boot with its Hard Drive. Now it boots up under 20 seconds. App launches are quick now. The overall system feels very snappy.

One interesting thing to note in the benchmarks is how the write speed is much lower when tested with 16GB. The SSD has 13GB of SLC cache, so as soon as the cache is filled, it has to start copying data into the TLC storage, which is why the speed tanks. If your workflow often requires you to copy large files then you might wanna look elsewhere. Otherwise its fine.

Overall, I am happy with its performance.",6,5
"UPDATE -- Best in class of budget Dram less Ssd. Very small, light weight.","I had purchased the BX500 240 GB variant a couple of months ago. Amazon delivered it reasonably quickly.

About the drive:
BX500 models have something known as SLC Caching, which Crucial calls ""SLC Write Acceleration"". What it basically means is that in the BX500 (and in several other budget and premium SSDs), there's a high-speed SLC cache and there's MLC/TLC (ignore these terms). This card has TLC, which is very slow. So if you are moving 20 GB data to a 240 GB variant of the BX500 SSD from let's say, another SSD, data transfer would be blazing fast for the first 16 GB (around 350-400 MB/s) and then it would slow down significantly (around 50-100 MB/s). For the 480 GB BX500, the SLC cache is of 32 GB, and it doubles with the next storage variants (64 GB SLC cache for 960 GB variant) as far as I know. Also, this SSD has a 3-year warranty and a fair endurance rating (check the product description on Crucial's website).

So for whom is it SSD suitable? It's for anyone who has used a laptop or a desktop before with a hard drive and now wants to use an SSD for better day-to-day speeds. It's for everyone who wants to do basic things on their computer like browsing the web, checking and sending emails. If you want an SSD that is a high performance, for editing photos and videos, playing games, or if you plan on using the SSD as a scratch disk, check out the MX500 (that has a 5-year warranty and a higher endurance rating) or SSDs from Samsung.",8,5

It just made life of my laptop by increasing its processing speed several times...,"Are you worried about your aging laptop and thinking of replacing with a new one. Then please hold on to your thoughts for a minute. You can get a new system kind of feel if you just spend around 6000 rupees from your pocket. Yes, you don't have to spend 30/40 thousand rupees for a new one. You can clone your old HDD with cloning software's and just remove old HDD and fit new SSD and you are done. Yes , it is so simple to speed up your system even though it's is 10 years old. One condition here is there you have to increase your RAM to 8 GB to get the full potential of your system
After doing all this you won't regret your decision.",2,5
Decent SSD.,"I have purchased Crucial 240GB SSD twice. The first one I purchased in Aug 2020. I can surely say that the performance of my laptop just had a J-curve. My laptop became so fast that I don't need to wait for anything.

Let me just tell you, my uses. I work in Chrome (the most with more than 20 tabs at the same time), Adobe Photoshop (sometimes), Adobe Illustrator (sometimes), Spotify, MS Office and some small apps. While coming to gaming I was playing games initially but not now. I completed the below list of games after installing SSD:
* Tomb Raider (2013) - Run flawlessly
* Rise of Tomb Raider - Run smoothly in the low setting with 1080p, and high setting with 720p
* Assassins Creed (I don't remember the part, but definitely not the old one, the graphics were good and was able to play in high setting in 1080p)
* Just Cause 3 (Worked well in Medium Settings)
* 2 more games which I don't remember the name of them.

Well, the use of SSD in gaming is reducing the startup time game and smooth transition while playing the game. I guess this SSD does that very well. I also want to highlight a point; my laptop has an I5 8th gen processor with an AMD graphics card and 8GB ram. So, the performance also depends on the other factors too, not SSD alone.

Important Note:
The second SSD which I purchased now, I installed in my old laptop which is around 8 years old with a very outdated processor and 4GB ram. This laptop gets slow if I update Windows 10 to the latest version and the cursor just stucks while moving. After installing SSD also, I was unable to update Windows 10 latest version, I have to use the 2019 version of Windows 10 and have to disable the auto-updates. The smoothness improved, but again high-end software or games can't be played. It's not the SSD's fault, it has other factors too.",4,4
"Excellent choice for some, not so great for the rest","This is useful for those who have a traditional hard disk and are frustrated by its speed (or lack of it 😄).
My HP pavilion 15 is 4 years old with 12GB RAM i5 and Windows 10. But the boot up time was around 2.5 minutes. Also I use Adobe softwares a lot (photoshop, Lightroom, premier Pro, After effect) and some of these softwares would take minutes to start. Now my laptop takes around 25 seconds to boot up (Yours could be less). Adobe Software's load time reduced to seconds.

Who should buy this SSD?
1. For beginners, who just want to give their PC a boost with a low budget.
2. For older PC'S AND LAPTOPS. It's self explanatory. Older computers have older hardware and just by upgrading to high speed storage it's not going to make much of a difference. So settle down for a cheaper one.
3. If you are not a heavy user.

If you have a budget then always go for SSD with DRAM like MX500 or Samsung EVO. There is no doubt that it would be considerably faster than these DRAM LESS SSD.

Hope it was helpful",8,4
It's really CRUCIAL.,"I'm a software programmer and hobbyiest Video maker. This was indeed a very good upgrade for my old Laptop. I was planning to upgrade my RAM from 4GB to 8GB as well; but the speed of this SSD could counter-balance the functional speed. I'm still planning to upgrade the RAM, but this SSD has served my purpose so far.

Visual Studio .Net and Video Editing packages like Filmora is working really good with this SSD. The lag is very less and it's only because of the lack of RAM, which I counter-act by not opening too many applications at once. The response speed of the SSD is good. I've not used SSDs from other companies so not sure how good it is compared with others. Just to mention, the Android Studio is still not as functional & smooth with this SSD.

If you're a gamer, this SSD may disappoint you. Also, if you're a heavy Video Editor or Photographer, this SSD is not for you, although you will find the rendering speed reduced compared with HDD.

This SSD is good for office purpose, software development purpose, casual Photoshop or Video editing purpose.",2,4
Great SSD at this price range.,"I bought this because my PC was taking too long to boot up - somewhere around 1 min 30 sec from cold start.

After I installed this SSD and moved my OS to this SSD, my PC boots up in just 10 sec which is amazing as I have a very old Intel Core 2 duo processor in my PC.

One minus point is that it doesn't come with any screws and the SATA cable -which you need to order separately if you don't already have them. For this I have reduced one star.",2,4
A must for systems speed improvement,"Many people on YouTube was talking about the Cache memory which is not bundle with BX500. So I contacted Crucial about the issue 'What is advantage of making such SSD which will get slow after some time'
See the reply (posted with this review), in short they are using SLC which prefer in Enterprises for fast operation.

Crucial is offering value for money device👍🏻
and also they have service support in almost every state of India.

This product is killing the competition no other SSD in this price range offering this much of Read/Write speed
I've also seen many people review about Gigabyte base level SSD's which have Cache memory but they mentioned clearly in their website that there is no cache memory in their base varient SSDs

But I don't know about the momentum cache in BX500 I tried to enable it on my PC but my system crashed which took me another couple of hour to reinstall window and all apps (😞 bad experience)

All review after 7 days of use.",2,4
Performance Improved,"Everything was good except the packaging. It creates a doubt that it's a fresh product or a used one. Company should improve the packaging as the actual manufacturing cost is very less. They are making huge profit and providing bad packaging.

Well working fine in my Dell laptop. Performance improved a lot. Boot time is now around 10 seconds, previously it was talking 35-45 sec to boot and was laggy.

If you want to add ram to make ur system fast then first upgrade to SSD first. Otherwise adding ram makes no sense.",Helpful,4
Good enough for the price,"Used in Lenovo g50-70 laptop and could clearly feel the speed after changing from HDD to SSD. But this was only for 40 days. After this Windows freezes often and disk usage is always at 100%. Read speed is still about 500MB/s, but write speed drastically reduced to about 10MB/s. It is now performing worse than HDD. Tried enabling over-provisioning, momentum cache, force garbage collection and all windows optimizations, but nothing worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of taking it to service center without any hope. Very disappointed with the product. All positive reviews seems to be only initial feelings. It is not a good product in the long run.

Edit:
I didn't have to go to service center. I searched the web a lot and found this solution for the slowness issue. I found that this is a known SSD performance degradation after a lot of writes to it. When I checked the Total Bytes Written (TBW) with CrystalDiskInfo it was 1.3TB. This was within 40 days of purchase. There were a lot of writes happening as my RAM was low and the OS was writing a lot to the page file in SSD. First I increased my RAM to avoid this and to restore my SSD write performance to its original state I did something called ATA Secure Erase. After this, it was as fast as when it was new. I did it using a terminal in live boot of linuxmint which is a bit tricky. You can search the web on how to perform ATA Secure Erase.

My general recommendations to avoid this issue:
1. Leave about 10% of the space as unallocated. It is called over-provisioning which is used by the SSD controller for TRIM/garbage collection.
2. Install Crucial Storage Executive and switch on momentum cache (if you have a power backup. A laptop will anyway have battery). You can search for more details about these online.
3. Upgrade your RAM so that you won't use page file much because of low memory.
4. Instead of cloning the present HDD with OS, it is better to install OS freshly on SSD. I think the TRIM commands that are sent by the OS to the SSD might not have happened correctly because of the cloning. While installing OS freshly on SSD all the settings will be chosen correctly by the OS.

All these are a hassle for a normal user and I don't recommend the product overall. Some say Crucial MX500 model is good as it has a DRAM cache which is very useful. Rs. 1000 more for better life and performance of SSD is worth it.

Another suggestion is to use a HDD caddy for second hard drive and write your media files to it, so that SSD is only used for OS and minimize the writes to SSD, thus prolonging its life. The endurance mentioned for this drive in their website is TBW of about 120TB.",5,4

Its my personal opinion may be there is no issues with other but I do not suggest this product. Better to buy Segate.
Anyways, amazon quick delivery always wins heart of customers. Super fast delivered by ATS. (Amazon Transport Service). For that 5 Full stars.",Helpful,4
Advance Cache memory?,"If you need this SSD for frequent data transfer tasks like moving large amounts of files, recording high bitrate footage (lossless), or using this SSD for virtual machines, get a different SSD instead - since this one doesn't have a DRAM cache. Write speeds tank down to about 10 MB/s and go as low as 7 MB/s after a while and the speeds stay that slow for the rest of that file transfer. Read speeds are still the same.

Everything else is fine, good cheap SSD, and if all you want to do with this is to copy a few games over once and enjoy quick loading times - go for it.",2,4

Useful tips in the description to resolve reduced write speed issue,"See I dont know about others, but for me its only lil bit faster than my hdd, as my hdd took 45-60 second to get booted and it tooks 30-45, so its like not a very good changes from hdd to ssd.

How a fan is possible inside a laptop dedicatedly to hard disk? don't know! I Will review further later... Screenshots of Crucial Storage executive attached which showing high temperature.",8,3
Personal Opinion - Product makes feel it's of low quality and cheap,"Its great that SSDs are common place now, however the process to install them has become complex.
Earlier I'd buy any capacity ssd and simply use a free utility, eg minitools partition, to copy the system partition. After the necessary changes in boot sequence it'd work.
However minitools doesn't offer its software for free and OEM software doesn't recognize the brand. (Imagine the stupidity)
So its basically unusable ""and lying on the shelf"" awaiting the hdd to crash totally.
Also the HDD will be 512Gb so you can't put your os on a 480Gb SSD and 1Tb is still not worth the price.
Brand provided Acronis software didn't read the Crucial SSD hence the most crucial piece of free software turned out to be the bottleneck.
And minitools license costs worth more than the ssd. Aaaaaaaaaaaaarghhh!!",4,3
Doesn't have a DRAM Cache! Write speeds tank down to ~10MB/s after a while!,"It will dead after few read & write operations, very disappointed. Looks like it's made of cheaper flash storage technology. Go for the NvmE (Non-volatile Memory) SSD which is made of better quality than it's SATA Counterpart. Don't ever use a SSD for virtual RAM or Swap Partition, because it will increase wear & tear at a rapid rate. The speed is very slow. I didn't like it's transfer rate.",2,3
Cheapness written all over?,"Write performance is very slow. Getting only 10MBps. Tried NTFS and ext4 partition but no difference on performance.

Finally after creating a bootable version of Acronis and booting into the app, i was able to clone the drive. But overall this was a very frustraring experience. On the contrary my experience with using samsung evo ssd was very smooth.

So I went to service center in Nanpura, Surat.

Firstly, service center person hesitated to take as it was getting detected. But he tried formatting it did not work. So he registered and gave me receipt and told in 15 days it will be replaced.

I did not receive any email or message for it. Even there is no website to track your replacement status.
So everytime I had to go to service center to check. I visited two-three times but till now it is about 30 days and service center still did not receive replacement of hard disk. Just yesterday I visited and he told it will take 15 more days. (Means overall 45 days for replacement)

When I connect the same SATA cable and Power cable my other drive, that drive works. I do not understand what to do. The SSD FAILED in just 4 months and 10 days. Kindly replace my SSD.

I wrote this review on 20 Feb 22.

Today is 04 Mar 22. But I have not received any response or replacement for my drive. So I presume the seller is not bothered about the customer or the product they sell or their own reputation.",289,1
Stopped working after Four months and bad service from service center,"-Honest Review after using it for 2 months-

Horribly damaged product received,"The worst decision i have ever made is buying this Crucial SSD. I have installed it with my HP PAVILION G6 1301TX laptop but it is not getting boot. After installing Windows it just simply does not show up in boot. Also in BIOS if i run hard disk diagnose it is showing error ""Hard Disk Error"". At boot screen ""DISK READ ERROR"". Now some people will say that i have not made bios settings correct and blah blah, I have done almost more than every possible tech thing to make it right. At last i had taken my laptop to repair center also. They also got the same error. And the most important thing is that in my laptop every other HDD is running good and no such problem is there. Only when i plug this SSD in SATA port again same error occurrs.Then i decided to replace the item . After receiving new SSD same problem is happening.
And the worst part is buying it on Amazon because there is no return policy only we are having replace policy. Now for me i have just wasted 3,000 rupees and for me it just a piece of waste plastic.
If any other person is having same problem or having solution for this , kindly mail me at ""gouravgrvh@gmail.com"".",28,1

The Drive Failed whilst working on PC and Seller not even looking at my problem.," This is the best budget gaming Laptop from HP in range of 58K to 72K. I got it at 59K. It has AMD Radeon RX5500M GPU which is better even better than NVIDIA 1650TI. I have uploaded the detailed benchmark scores, check that in picture. The laptop is extremely good. Build Quality is just solid, awesome. This laptop has extreme battery & cooling performance. It performs far better than ASUS TUF A15/F15 1650TI Variant. ASUS TUF's cooling is very bad & battery life is 1.5 to 2.5 hours. HP VICTUS RX5500M gives a battery life of more than 4 hours.

Updating review on 03.05.2022.
Pro & Cons:
PROS:
• Latest Gen AMD Processor better than all intel i7,i5,i3 CPUs
• White Backlit Keyboard
• FHD Screen Resolution
• Best for gaming, 3-D modelling, graphics design, coding, game making.
• Dedicated GPU, AMD Radeon RX5500M 4GB is present which outperforms 1650TI variant in other laptops, check benchmarks.
• 3x USB3 port at 5Gbps speed & 1 type-C port supporting 4K display from discrete GPU + 1RJ45 LAN port + 1 HDMI 2.1 port + 1 SD card slot + 1 3.5mm audio combo port
• 4 Cell 70WHr battery which lasts about 5-6 hrs. when running 5+ chrome tabs watching YouTube VS code running. i.e. Extreme Battery Performance..... ASUS TUF provides 2-3 hrs backup 48WHr battery.
• Both single & multi core performance beat up intel's latest i7 CPUs also
• MS Office provided free
• Cooling is just awesome. ASUS TUF has very bad cooling but HP Victus is just OMEN 2. Fan speed can also be controlled at OMEN GAMING HUB.
• GPU turns of automatically/remains idle if no heavy GPU dependent tasks are running rather i-GPU keeps working for light GPU dependent tasks, this saves battery to a extreme extent.
• Budget Friendly
• 150W charger/adapter, so charging is extremely fast.
• Speakers are also nice and feels good.
• Trackpad is also very good, far better than that of other laptops.

CONS:
• White Backlit Keyboard (single color)
• Screen wobbling (this is not a major issue, this can be easily ignored, stable until forced vibrations are produced)
• 60Hz Display refresh rate.
• Weight 2.4 KGs

Games I have played on this:
Red Dead Redemption 2 - High Graphics (8GB RAM), Ultra graphics (16GB RAM) - 55fps min 60 fps max
Watch Dogs 2 - Ultra graphics 52fps min 60fps max
Call of Duty WWII - High Graphics (8GB RAM), Ultra (16GB) 45fps min 60fps max
Microsoft Flight simulator 2020 - Medium Graphics (8GB RAM), Ultra (16GB) - 48fps min 60fps max

Waste of money seriously!," I bought this laptop for ₹62,000, (although the price dips at times to ₹58,990). It is one of the best laptops in this price segment considering both it's performance and functionality.
Pros:
1. It has the Radeon 5500m graphics card, which is better than the GTX 1650, that you will find in other similar, lower and even some higher priced laptops. The 5500m can easily run all recent titles at medium to high settings, 1080p 60fps. In older games like battlefield 1, GTA 5, Metro Redux, etc you can crank the settings to ultra and the fps will remain at 60fps.
2. The Ryzen 5 5600H is a beast of a processor and can handle anything that you can throw at it.
3. The 70 watt hour battery (compared to the 50 watt hour that you will find in other laptops) easily gives around 6hrs of normal use e.g. browsing, youtube, video playback, a bit of photoshop etc. while the other laptops in the price segment can hardly manage 4hrs.
4. The build quality is amazing. Its made for people, like students who need a daily driver laptop which can game and at the same time does not look too flashy. Its functional, the keyboard is good, mousepad feels good to use and the overall build quality is great.
5. Viewing angles are great, no glare or reflections as it is a matt finish screen.

Cons:
1. The fan intake vents are on either sides of the laptop. So if you are using the laptop, keeping it on your lap, the fan intakes will get blocked. You will have to keep a hard, flat base underneath in order to prevent the intakes from getting blocked.
2. The laptop is a bit heavy and if you are thinking of keeping it on your lap and using it, good luck. Your legs are going to go numb in a very short time.
3. The screen does not get very bright. So it will be difficult to use it outside, under direct sunlight.

*Note:
In many online reviews you will find complains about screen wobbling, but the issue is not as much as they are making it to be. The screen has a normal amount of wobble which you will find in most other similar sized laptops.

And if you are looking for a laptop for gaming only, don't buy this. Rather go for something with a 3050. This is good for casual gaming (it can run all games but you'll have to compromise on the graphics a bit) but not for playing all games at maxed settings and streaming at the same time.

I've run the following games on this laptop and all of them work great:
Days Gone
NFS Heat
GTA 5
Battlefield 1
Metro Redux
Dishonored 1 & 2",4,1
Very bad warranty and support," Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.

edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.

Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop as cool as possible.

I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner.

I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity. For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.

HP factory setting for this laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.

With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.

For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again. So I used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.

Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .

The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500m

Also recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience. I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.

edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.

edit2:
Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick.",4,1
Worst product I have ever purchased online.,"After using for 10 days I am writing this review.. I am a hardcore gamer. I use this laptop like 8 to 13 hours daily..
Screen is fantastic
Inbuilt speaker is good but you can use Bluetooth speaker and take advantage of B&O amplifier
Processor ryzen 5600h one of the best all rounder
Graphics Amd Radeon 512 mb which is good for light usage
Discrete Graphic card 4gb rx 5500m for high graphic contents & gaming ultimate which is better than 1650 & 1650 TI
Battery 75w for gaming arround 2 hours 15 mins with 30% brightness for Normal usage with less brightness you will get arround 5 hours
Full charge takes arround 1 hour 50 mins and charger capacity is 150 watt so here cpu will consume 45w and GPU will consume 85w.. it's important to plug in your laptop before playing any games to get maximum performance.. use omen gaming hub software to reduce the noise of the fan while playing at night..
And the Bottom-line is every laptop has its own ups and downs but hp has created one of the best gaming laptop.. except 60 hrz display due to price fixation",5,1
DO NOT BUY THIS SSD FOR MACBOOK PRO,"I spent 2 stressful months doing research fot my perfect laptop. Many laptops have on-paper similar specs. So it can be confusing. But most of them have hidden flaws/hidden features which u can't see. So here u go, why this is The Best. I am not going to list the obvious ones.

Pros:
70Whr battery. U can't find in any laptop in this range
Two M.2 slots. Rare feature.
RX5500M GPU. Rare GPU in any price. GTX1650 is no match against this monster(in gaming).
2 memory slots. No soldered memory.
Flicker free display.
RAM upgrade supported upto 32GB. Which most Lenovo and Pavillion laptop don't give

Cons:
Heavy- 2.5Kg
Build quality ok, plastic. Not great. Tight hinge. Display wobbles a bit.
RX5500M is only good for gaming. Not for machine learning or video rendering.
Linux support is really bad. Wifi and GPU driver took real hard work to make it work. If u don't disable secure boot then Linux won't boot initially.
No MuX switch. (This feature is not created for poor people like me. Rich people with budget more than 80K can afford it).",5,1
Best Budget Gaming Laptop from HP,"Every laptop in this range comes with compromises. This one has 60Hz screen and is heavy(2.5 kg). Screen wobbles, not much of an issue but it's noticeable sometimes when using on soft surfaces like bed.
Battery life is excellent for a gaming laptop. Processor and GPU are the best in price range. Backlit keyboard is nice. Screen is also good. Camera sucks. Speakers have moderate volume. Good amount of ports provided.

It is a laptop to be considered by a student with budget 60K as its performance is one of the best in the price range with some compromises which students can easily overlook, also all-day battery life is also something to look for and is rare in gaming laptops.",125,5
Best bang for the buck laptop in this price range,"I have purchased this laptop on December 2021. I was in the limited budget of 60k but I liked to buy the 1650 variant but it costs extra 5k... So I bought RX5500M variant and my decision was satisfied. Laptop performance is better. I have completed God of War 2018 PC with this laptop and streamed it on YouTube without any issue. Faced frame drops on some places but that's normal for this budget.

Display is only 60Hz, it's a drawback for hardcore gamers. If u have a planning to upgrade it with external monitor, it will not be a issue.

Only one negative point I was faced is with Amazon delivery. Even though the product is absolutely fine, the packaging is worst. They haven't even packed, they just sent it with the laptop box by sticking the address itself. There is no extra packing from the vendor side. While I'm unboxing it I found a hole on the pack and shocked but thank god laptop wasn't damaged.

I know I can replace it with Amazon policy but still it will take another 7 days to get a new one that will be a disappointment for me. I think it was shipped from Lucknow and delivered in Chennai in a week.

I suggest Amazon and vendor to be more careful on packing.

Once again thanks for this product Amazon. Because this model is only available on Amazon and I can't any where in offline and online stores.",81,5
Overall Good Laptop for both medium-high graphic quality gaming and work/anything else," This is very good laptop i check all test ij this laptop that result is incredible test like cinebinch test 3d mark test and pcmark 10.
And also i am YouTuber then this laptop also good for video editing.
Battery is so good👍👍👍",16,5
Best Gaming Laptop,"Got my laptop today!
Things I have noticed
1. Great screen - for coding, media consumption gaming although its 60Hz but its good.
personally I would prefer choosing 60Hz (compromising battery for Visual pleasing)
2. B&o audio settings are also reasonably good.
3. keyboard and typing experience is good but i am still getting used to it, I am scared of hitting the powerbutton which is rt above backspace key so I am pretty much scared to use them..(Refer the pic)
4. Really liked the trackpad on this device.Super
5. it feels fast but yea to write a review about its performance in the very first day is quite independable.
6. Havent tested any games, I know it will work most of AAA title games with its full swing, but i am slightly concerned about RX5500m used for constructing machine learning models,..And there are obviously certain applications which has an NVidea autonomy over them.
7. Wobbling...its noticable but trust me it ll not intefere with your work...hinge feels safe and 'V' logo is charming.
8. its a bit too heavy; like other laptops in this catogory.
9. Expandability and upgradability are soothning.
10. Battery bakup -dont know🤷‍♂️ but yea 70whr battery could be a thing for you.

Mini Omen but Value for money is simply superb.....I wish i get it for 56k....(got it for 60k)
i ll surely update about anything else if its concerning.",13,5
Beast in this price,"This is my first review here on Amazon and it couldn't have been any better.
Just had upgraded from i-3 processor with integrated graphics, straight to this beast and no regrets in buying it because it's simply the best in this price range.
After going through numerous YouTube videos, reviews, unboxing of all different kinds of laptops within my budget range, i finally stood upto it and fell in love with this product.

The build quality feels premium and the touch can be felt without making a fuss about it.
There's a big screen of 16 inch and for multimedia, work, playing games, it's just perfect.
The new AMD processor is a beast and it boots in just 5 seconds while AMD Radeon graphics is a perfect picture adding to its beauty.
Fast processes and quick responses makes it even better.

For hardcore gamer, this might be not to buy option because of 60hz refresh rate, but for casual gamer, this laptop is packed with everything you can get under 60k.

Happy with the purchase and don't hesitate because this is one of the best under 60k segment.",12,5
Could be the best for your budget,"I have purchase this laptop for Coding + Video edition + Causal gaming.

Pros :
AMD Ryzen 5600H is best. Fast processing
Boot timing is 8-10 Sec
No heating
No Fan noise
Sound is good
Windows 11 is updated and running smoothly
Got the MS office 2019 license version
Keyboard is good for typing/Display is good

Cons :
-Heavy in weight (2.48Kg) -
-Internet issue - Sometimes, when you hit any website it will not launch that website. I am not sure the root cause of this issue . It may be the home wifi issue or laptop wifi card/update issue. (Please check other comments if someone had faced the same).
-Ram is using 6.5 GB out of 8 GB (only few s/w install, better to add 8 GB RAM)

Perfect budget gaming laptop," I just got the Item. Now it looks good. Detailed review later.
Edit : After 1 and half month usage this is a beast in a executive look. For this price (60k when I bought. Now selling for 55k in sale offer) there no need to look around, grab this one. Awesome IO, upgradable ram and ssd slots, nice design, bang for the buck performance it's a complete package. For me the 60hz display and little screen wobble isn't a problem.
Changing 4 stars to 5.",5,5
Value for engineer students 😍😍😍,"I got the all amd one for 59k with a logitech g402 for free.

upgradable ram
71 WattHour battery
Good selection of ports
Rx 5500m graphics are better than 1650 and 1650 ti which are at similar or even higher price points.

Large trackpad
Backlit keyboard

Cons:-
60 hz display, okay for single player aaa titles but not for esports like csgo, valorant.
Low peak brightness
Infamous screen wobble but not to worry about if you just keep it on a desk.

Its main competition is msi bravo 15 and anf msi gf63 with 10500h and 3050,although the latter has only 40watt tgp gpu

BEAST....,"The camera is very wide, so check your background before a call. Battery backup with saver and 25% brightness is 7 to 8 hours, so excellent capacity. As for gaming, you can get 50 to 70 fps on almost every triple-A game (like Yakuza Like a Dragon and Genshin Impact). As for software, it has both omen gaming hub and AMD software, so very customisable depending on the needs. The Keyboard is perfect, and the build is very sturdy though the screen wobbles sometimes.",3,5
Best laptop at INR 56K(Review after 1 month of Usage),"Gaming - 10/10, fps in most latest well
demanding games is well above 50 range.
Thermals- 5/10, in ambient room temp of 35-40+ range the thermals are below average only while playing games like red dead redemption 2. The gpu temp touches 85+ degrees c. But if you have AC room that is not a problem. In the long run the gpu life is affected a lot by high temps. So better thermals would have been appreciated here. But whilst idle, the thermals are good enough. Roughly in the range of 50-60degrees c. Fan mode doesnot help much if your ambient temps are high. Rx 5500m is very close to rtx 3050 without dlss of nvidia. Ofcourse after dlss rtx wins easily in supported games.

Battery- 10/10, easily getting 8-10hours of backup surfing web and watching videos..and Charging is very fast.

Display - 7/10, just above average and what you expect from this range gaming laptops. 60 hertz is just okay. Not extremely enjoyeable multimedia experience.

Sound speakers- 6/10, average again, with vlc you can increase to 200% volume but it can damage the speakers in long run. Earphone sound is great.

Camera-5/10 , just average class.

Overall performance- 9/10, great performance in totality. And best to get it on sales when it goes as low as 55k range.

Overall can't go wrong with this in the 55k range.",12,4

Good laptop for 59k,"The HP bios wont let you reduce the reserved ram for integrated graphics, which is locked at 512MB and another 140mb for hardware , which leaves only 7.3GB ram for OS use , I wont forgive HP for such bad bios feature , meanwhile ASUS and DELL laptops have these features , Rest of the aspects are all GOOD. screen wobble is not really an issue like others are saying , good keyboard and bright backlight , good for mid range gaming. HP has always been against power users. WiFi card don't have good drivers for linux. One plus point is a large trackpad.",6,4
"Super at this price range ,but screen is Little bit wobling","Pros
1) Value for money.
2) Handles most games with ease. Although, adding another 8Gb RAM is recommended. Dedicated GPU is okay.
3) Pre-installed office home and auto-update to windows 11 home is handy .
4) Keyboard spacing is fine.
5) Fast booting.

Cons
1) Screen wobbling is there.
2) Battery backup is poor. Deducting one star for the same.
3) I don't understand why they are providing unwanted keys like game hub and calculator?? Also, Power key should be provided separately, away from keyboard console.
4) Not bright. Okay for normal usage",7,4

The screen definitely wobbles when put under full speed ceiling fan, which does not hinder the user experience that much but its a real pain in ass when using the webcam as the screen continuously wobbles because of fan.

GPU DRIVER ISSUE ON MANY GAMES!!!!!

😃If u are worried about screen wobbling the u should not have because unless u use it in your lap it doesn't noticable and u can't use it in your lap for long time due to its more than 2kg weight, so don't worry.

😔Screen resolution needed to be more because of 16.1inch panel the pixel density become low so you have at least watch at 1080p minimum for satisfying results in Full screen,my unit has thermal issue

😔Camera 📷 quality is very bad it's .9mp although it's look like because of the 1080p 16.1inch large screen it's look worse than it is in original

👍Pros-awsome keyboard ,5600h is extremely
powerful for day to day use,all ports
present, good for editing and professional
use, large trackpad ,150 watt charger,70
watt-hour battery,extra slot for SSD and
Ram upgradation future proof, although
it's plastic but of very good quality,flex

👎Cons-speaker output low, screen quality is
very.
charging time more than 2hr with
150 watt charger,vents are smaller
although it looks like big only the fans
have cutout , 📷 camera quality is very
poor not usable enough to video call,

I bought this controller so I could play PUBG on mobile; its different from playing with touch but I guess after a few games I've gotten used to it. The plus point is that you don't have to struggle to press so many buttons at the same time as it's smooth and feels like playing on a console.

Amazing Buy,"For this price point I don't think it's possible to buy such a stellar and well built controller, what makes this better than the Redgear ones is the option for button remapping on android phones, though it is complex, just having the option is an advantage. I mainly used this for PC gaming and lemme tell you the vibration motor on this is far better than I'd expected. the buttons are sufficiently tactile and responsive and there seems to be little to no lag in gameplay. The build quality is a little hollow and might break easily upon dropping it, but it's sturdy and feels good to hold while gaming. It being rechargeable as opposed to battery powered makes it easier to use in the long run and the battery life was consistently 8-9 hours on a full charge. Shoulder triggers are a little weak but overall, for the price this is a beautiful controller to buy for PC gaming or mobile gaming, not to mention the only somewhat classy modern looking one at this price range.",52,5
Totally Worth,"Got it some 10 days back. And it's awesome. Gameplay with pc and Android is really good. Manual is self explanatory. Button mapping with Android is simple, bit tricky in begining.

Totally worth the money,"I bought it around three months back and it has a fairly decent built quality. Setting it up is also easy.

Awesome,"This gamepad will be my personal recommendation for anyone with a tight budget cause it supports almost every device and works without any flaws

On PC, I've found no issues till now. Awesome gaming experience 😄

Battery life is also amazing on this device. I've hardly charged it fully twice till now. Once charged, it should be good for atleast 3-4 days.

* Battery life is excellent 8hrs battery life can be expected.
* Fast and reliable connectivity
* Little bit deficult to learn initially
* R1, l1 buttons are useless you are not going to use them
* Little to no delay
* Button mapping is a little bit tricky
* Instructions manual is incorrect ..(hold HOME+Afor button mapping as some games don't support external controller. Press and hold HOME+X button for the games with native controller support)
* Vibration is not available for mobile.",3,4

For build quality it is not that good. It felt plasticky and cheap. At lower price cosmic byte and red gear controllers has better quality. Controller works like std x input controller. It has some button mapping for Android games like pubg free fall, which is basically cheating but who m i to judge. I think they can make a document for connecting i had so much problem with connecting this to devices.
Overall ok ok controller but build quality can be better.",Helpful,4
Overall satisfied,"I play games on PC and I wanted to try how a controller would work with CODM. This one doesn't work directly with CODM inbuilt controller support but can be made to work with an app called ShootingPlus V3. Though it is a bit tricky to configure, at least it will work.
The struggle starts now. It requires adopting to and getting used with the muscle memory to play with it on phone. I felt playing with 4 finger claw grip is way better and investing time and money on this controller didn't make any sense for me.

Coming to the PC part: This is almost similar to the Xbox controller in shape, size and key layout including the triggers.
The only downside is that the tension in the trigger spring is not as hard as I would expect it to be. It feels mushy. I couldn't use them precisely in Need for Speed Heat and Forza Horizon 4 which can use the analogue triggers for acceleration and brakes. I had better experience with the RedGear controller triggers over this one. But every other key has good feedback and has low noise when pressed.
The analog sticks are better on this one over the redgear one.

Verdict: If you don't mind the free playing analog triggers and if you are already used to FPS games with controllers, I think that is when you can go with this.

I would suggest trying it out by yourself. Thanks to Amazon return policy, you can still return it if you don't like it as long as the return window is open.",Helpful,4
Never regret,Well my game quality doesn't improve in freefire its better i play without any gamepad. Overall didn't like it. Not satisfied at all.

Joystick control not suitable for cod game," I received it the day before yesterday and I have already run out of patience with this one. The controller has major issues and is not market-ready yet, I believe proper quality testing wasn't done. I don't have many positives to write other than that the manufacturer trying to develop such an item at a reasonable price. The most frustrating part is saving a mapped button loadout and then loading it. Making sure it works correctly when you load it again after, maybe, taking a break or rebooting the controller can be extremely frustrating. The video above has been provided for reference purposes as to what is the issue.

I already had an instance when I tried to load a profile I saved on the device and not to the app which failed to load when I rebooted the controller. In addition to the above, changing profiles is not as easy as it looks and if you do change it, the controller turns into a brick. I tried to activate all three profiles to save, it doesn't work, the 4th profile on the controller doesn't even load. I tried calling the support number provided but all calls went unanswered and I tried within the time frame given on Claw's website. For those who have made it work, kudos to them, but this definitely has a lot of issues and is something I will not recommend buying.

However, as I noted above, good job to the makers for trying to offer such a vast variety of customisation on a mobile compatible controller, including setting up your own scripts to run a command and many more at a decent price. If only it would work as intended.",2,3
"Even if you take it, you will not be satisfied"," Honestly for the price I expected better , previously purchased the amkette evo elite gamepad ( pretty similar in price ) and have to say the quality of the packaging & the product were much better . Claw is a let down for the price .

Overall quality is kinda disappointing , but it does the job hence 2.5/5(imo) .

I then started mapping mode and suddenly V3 app shows ""device connected"" and when i tried to mapped keys on COD it says ""Failed to load preset"".

d pad faces problem after 4-5 days. this is my second controller and both of them faced the same issue.
the first one i returned but this time i ain't gonna return as i don't have the patience and all of them have been made similarly and cost cutting has been done. whenever you press the right d pad, the up presses automatically which is the major problem especially in games like street fighter/contra/bomberman and tekken. similarly when you press the left d pad the up button presses along with it which will make your experience frustrating",14,2

I have ordered three of these controllers for my family and myself. In two of these controllers, the left analog stick has ghost input. The connection is shoddy at best, frequently disconnecting between gaming sessions.

However, the third one is good. The feel is great. I love the form factor and the feel in hand. It fits your palm perfectly, and the Xbox like controls makes it feel exactly 'right'.

Could've been a great prodoct but,"Have purchased this item months ago & have used it extensively. Great controller with tons of customizing options but it's severly limited because of the software.

I hv to calibrate & save the settings every single time I want to play the game & even while playing this controller automatically forgets & resets itself to default, then whole thing have to be done again.
I have three devices at home all with SD 810 or above SoC and able to achieve 60 fps in all the titles I play, hence hardware limitations is out of question fr my devices.
I have posted a similar review for the software support in Play store, but not got any reply, & there were similar reviews about this glitch on play store.

It took a total of 14 days to get back my controller and again with the same issue. I raised the complain and they replaced it, yet again got a defective controller with a software issues where my right stick automatically raised itself when i vertically move my left stick thay too without touching the right one.

Bad quality control.,A honest review....there is an action delay while playing....its better to play on mobile rather using this device as the action doesnt match the game requirements..if you have to shoot now it will take 1 sec delay to perform actually and the result is against you...,2,1

DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS,"One of the worst after sales service. Warranty claim process is way too complicated. Its basically guve them money buy a product, then if you encounter any issues, spend some more money to get claim your warranty which should be taken care of by the company but they don't. It defies all the odds of gaming as if you play using the controller the buttons tend to lose the response time they should provide. Absolute waste!",One,1
Worst Product,"I have bought 3 of them one after the other working a month.
The product is Extremely workable, practical and sturdy.
I and my children have been using it for a month. It’s a must have great product. My son is a Software developer and daughter a photographer.
My kids spondylitis has gone as the constantly looking down was the cause which has been removed by this laptop stand.
Don’t think- just buy.

Cannot play with this one anymore,Good quality build that can hold up a 17 inch laptop screen to eye level. i don't use the mobile holder because there's no way to keep the mobile upright in there with the charging cable connected. But that doesn't matter because I bought this product for the laptop stand and I'm very happy with that. You'll wonder how you lived without this.,Helpful,1
Controller Disconnected,"I really liked this one. Serves it's purpose quite well.

Pros:
1) The stand has adjustable positions as mentioned.
2) It is sturdy. People complaining that typing makes it shake but you are not supposed to type when you sit this up at an extreme angle. It's uncomfortable to type like that. I tried on my lap and kept it at a lesser angle and it was okay to type. On a table it might move the laptop a bit if you sit this up and type but that's not because the product is not sturdy but the way it's being used. It doesn't hold the laptop screen to not allow it to shake. It's normal.
3) The rotatable base doesn't exist. Although it's mentioned in a question and people assuming it, the product description never says that it's rotatable. In any case, without rotation it gives a better sturdiness feel when it's sitting on a table.
4) Can be used on your lap if needed.

Caution:
1) Make sure to flip the 2 laptop base holder up if you use it on a table instead of your lap. Otherwise, the laptop might slide down. Happened to me as I use this on a moving table that has wheels. I missed to do that and the laptop came down and dropped my keyboard once. Once I flipped it up, even after shaking it decently it doesn't slide down nor moves.",Helpful,1
Delay in action...,"Very nice 👌 laptop stand. Even though it is breakable plastic, the stand is pretty sturdy. Lightweight and good looking.
7 slots for different heights but for a more flatter but raised stand, I also put use the last support at the end. You can check in my photo.
Also, the phone stand is very helpful for meetings and video calls, but normally I don't need to use it on day to day basis. Can be fixed on either side- removable but not foldable.
Overall, a great stand at good price. Thanks!! 😀😀",One,1
It is not working proper with My S20 FE 5g,After going over all the options on Amazon I chose this one as it also had an additional mobile stand. But after used it for a week I m really happy with my choice. The product is not only fantastic in terms of quality and sturdiness but also very useful for peopl working from home and spending 8 to 10 hours on laptop. I have seen the strain on my neck and shoulders come down drastically and am hoping that it will get better with this sweet little inclusion in my work from home set up. Highly recommend it.,One,1
Not worth money,"I bought it the moment I saw it on a youtube channel. It was something I was seriously wanting as I work long hours from morning to night on laptop. This has helped me solve the neck issue. My laptop can be opened any degree and used. No need to keep books underneath to raise height.
But the main reason is it provides best ventilation for my laptop.
Its adjustable height option is well thought.
Also a side mobile stand is a bonus. They could start making add ons 😂",Helpful,1
"Excellent Product, Just buy it","This stand is made of nice hard plastic. My 15.6 inch laptop is being supported without any instability very firmly. I came to know the usefulness of such a stand for long working hours or watching entertainment programs This stand has made it a pleasure to work on the laptop and also typing on the keyboard is easy & accurate. Another important aspect of such a stand is the cooling vents are free and the air circulation is good, thus keeping the laptop cool without overheating. The negative is that I found the side stand for mobile is of not much useful value as it makes the bottom vital touch keys and the charger port inaccessible thereby disabling mobile functionality. The price at which the stand is being sold is a worthy deal. I paid ₹389/00 with 5% cashback and free shipping with AmazonIcici Credit card, being a prime customer.",16,5
One of the best laptop stands available for larger laptops.,"Completely satisfied with the laptop stand. Indeed the stand came in the well packed manner .

Now , About the laptop stand, it's quality plastic . It's so sturdy while typing expirence is good too , tried it with a nearly 2kg lap also. The Flat surface at the bottom is very helpful compared to the aluminium ones while working on bed scenarios. In my opinion I've never felt the weight of the stand being a factor while working on bed. And the Multiple viewing angles are great and very helpful too. Dint have to strain my eyes much . The Mobile holder is Big A++.

It's a Must buy if your up for streaming. Dint knew it wud be of so helpful for me , like in every possible way. Once used It's like we needed as routine part of our life .",15,5
Awesome product,"The stand is exactly what it says it is. Sturdy and able to bear even heavy laptops. It's best if you are stuck working from home and don't want to experience what spondylitis is. It raises your laptop to the desired level which will maintain your sitting position like a normal human being and not turn you into those little worm aliens from Men In Black. The phone stand is pretty cool too if you wanna slack off and watch stand up comedy videos while you're supposed to be working.
Get it and you won't need to buy another stand for at least 5-6 years if you use it properly.",4,5
Great laptop stand 👍👍,"This is one product which i really want to thank. I was suffering from neck pain for several months since the inception of wfh, i did exercises, applied balms, got massaged, but its always there the next day, i changed positions, adjusted chair and table, even bought a table top,but none helped. Finally i found this and its been a month since i have had any neck pain, thanks once again!",5,5
Perfect friend for a work from home,"I'm using this as a stand for my 15"" MacBook pro, and its pretty sturdy, the variable angle options really help in different scenarios. Holds the grip on the surface really well!

I bought an other similar product, which had the 360 degree rotating support on the bottom, which helped sometimes, this product had circular markings on the bottom, but the rotating disc was missing I guess :\
But it wasn't worth the pain to get a replacement of this product, so using this without the rotating disc. If it matters to you, please note that the rotating disc may be missing.",7,5
Must if you use laptop for long duration or short,"Nice product. Matches to the exact detail mentioned in product description.
Height can be adjusted through wide range. Mobile holder also given which cab be attached to it.
Not too heavy. Easily portable.
Have rotating base which makes it easy to turn laptop if needed.",One,5
Laptop stand is very stable and useful.," Check out the images and the video, you will get a good idea.

PROs👍🏻
1. White color looks premium❤️
2. Pretty stable even at 60-70 degree angle
3. My laptop is 15.6', heavy with all metal body and it hangs on pretty well
4. The mobile holder is a nice add-on
5. Plastic quality is standard, not very fragile
It can be easily folded and carried in a laptop bag, so it's handy as well

CONs👎🏻
1. and only 1. The only issue that I see is that it's made of plastic which doesn't seem to last forever. But at this price point, I don't expect to buy a carbon fibre material 😅

I would say, this product justifies the price ask. Looks lot promising than other plastic laptop stands.",Helpful,5
💯% Satisfied,"The product has a overall good look and feel and is quite sturdy to use, except the fact that it has two legs for the adjuster which does not seems to be the best thing to have for durability as these may break off leaving the entire set useless. But I am yet to experience how they go about. Having said this, the ergonomics of the product is not very good as the lowest tilt angle it offers is also too high while using it placed on your work desk and that's where most of us will be using this product on. It should offer a low tilt so that the ventilation can happen beneath the surface without giving stress to neck. It offers you a placement angle of minimum 45degrees to 60 degrees. I think it should have offered a 15-20 degree angle to serve the ventilation purpose.

P.S: I bought this product for 599 after waiting for a long time and seeing quite higher prices upto 1499. If you are considering to buy this 599 is the max I would want to pay for this. It simply doesn't offer more value than this. I am kind of OK, not fully satisfied.",One,5
Worth spending the money to prevent neck problems in the future," What would someone who owns a laptop expects from a laptop stand?
Stability, Safety from damage, Cost effective, Good quality of material?
What if i say you'll get them all in this laptop stand which even i personally use for my experience i would say this one is the best highest quality laptop stand one could ever find...
Go for it!!!!",4,5
Perfect!!,"good, sensible product
can really help with reduciing neck stress duee to long usage of laptops, and peering down
however, it can be improved further by
a. adding an instruction manual
b. letting the phone holder channel also swivel if one swivels the stand
c. adding a contraptin by which the whole frame could be lifted by ,say, 6-10 inches.

typing at the angle is putting some stress on the wrist.",One,5
"Great product, but missing rotating disc","After reading positive & negative reviews, i thought to given it a try & order this. Although, its madeup of plastic but i would say good plastic is used & given rubber bushes so that laptop wont get slip from anywhere. There are different level of adjustment for laptop according to the level of height. The side stand for laptop is given as mobile stand which is also a good feature. this way one can easily see any messages on mobile.
Overall, the product seems good & utility item if you are working for long hours on laptop....with good price tag.",113,4
Worth the money laptop stand,"Sturdy, compact and nice product. Useful for watching videos or sitting upright and working without neck pain. But since the angle of the keyboard also lifts up with the hinge (which is unavoidable in any product), typing for longer time causes pain in the wrists as the wrists are also kept inclined.

Defenitely can feel the wrist pain in a day usage itself. I use a seperate external keyboard on the flat table which helps.

Great for viewing angle and can sit upright. Typing is the only issue.",101,4
"Great product, Price justified","If you're wise enough you'll go for it without thinking twice! Although different customers got it at different price segment, I payed 399 including discounts and offers. At this price point, the product justifies what it's made for. Multiple angles, makes enough space for better airflow, mobile holder can be placed on either side. I'm satisfied.",18,4
Excellent quality and sturdiness but the product lacks ergonomics,"I was a bit skeptical about it after reading a few reviews mentioning that it's not stable and is of low quality. But, after getting it, I found it of decent quality and is stable. I won't say it's a VFM product but the difference isn't much considering that there are phone holders now costing this much.

There's nothing to dislike about the product which is why I've rated it 4stars.

But, there's enough room to improve the design.

There is gap between the laptop and the bottom plate it's resting on as you can see in the third image. The gap can be reduced if I position the stand at it's lowest position but there's still gap which means the triangular foam pads in the center of the base plate never touch the laptop. At the position I've set it on, the foam pads on the bottom are also barely touching the laptop as you can see in the image.

The whole laptop is prevented from sliding by a lip at the end of the frame which maintains the most contact with the laptop and should have the foam pads instead. This lip should also have a cut in the center to lift the lid up as in my case, I've to lift the Mac up to open it as there's no gap to open it. Then, I've to lift the laptop again when closing it as the lid touches the lip instead of closing completely.

The conclusion of this design flaw is that it's not a one hand easy task to open it and you've to be careful everytime you close or open it so to not damage the laptop. Although, this issue isn't there for thicker laptops like typical Dell/Lenovo.

Conclusion, It's sturdy and of decent heavy built plastic but the design flaw is cumbersome for Macs/Thin laptops.",17,4
Really a high quality laptop stand worth every penny,"Pros:
1. It's plastic so light weight.
2. Level adjustments is good with different angels.
3. Movie holder or table holder is Handy.
4. Not tilting and study on flat surface

Cons:

1. Plastic feels cheap not durable.
2. No CPU cooling fan
3. Very very pricey. Paid 599 for just cheap plastic
4. For that price they could have include a cooling fan.

Over all i don't say not to buy but look for other options.",11,4
good product- can improve with tipps for better and correct usage,"It is a nice product, but there is one problem with it. When you type on laptop, it vibrates to and fro.
This due to the slim plastic body. I returned the product due to this reason.

Also the actual product is from Cooskin company not striff.",14,4
Sturdy & utility for Laptop users,"To be honest its a great product....it is light weight, nicely built, awesome ergonomic.
But i only give it 3 stars because of the fact that it is made up of plastic.
No matter how it is built, but plastics are tend to break easily. I will suggest every probable buyer to go for metal ones, the product which is made up of metal.
If u want to carry this laptop stand frequently with you then there is no match for this in the market....but i highly doubt that people need to carry it and move so frequently.",7,4
Good product but causes wrist pain if used for typing long,"This is good for portability as its lightweight and can carry it along in a backpack - I personally liked it.

however, if you are looking for a laptop to be more like a desktop setup in such a case go for CoolMaster. They are Durable, heavy and expensive

I have both to make best use for home station and for travelling time (This product)",4,4
Best on Budget,"The product is light weight but there is no instruction card to know how to set it up. I almost thought I broke mine because I didn’t know where to pull it out from the flat packed condition. It’s only been 2-3 days so too soon to say whether I like it. Although typing at an angle is something to get used to. The mobile holder could have had a way to insert a charging wire below so that while the phone is on the stand, it can charge. This provision seems missing.",3,4
Liked it!,"The stand itself is good, but it is too small for a 15.6 inch laptop. So as you can see in the photo, the rear rubber foot of the laptop does not rest on the support, so the support ends up covering the laptop ventilation holes. I check with three15.6 inch laptops and the same problem is there, so i cannot use it for any of the laptop. Not can i return it since it has only replacement option.",2,4
Useful but not worth of the price,I would say this is kaam chalo product. Worth spending the money here rather than spending in a silmilar expensive item as both will deliver the same value more or less... 3 star because it's an ok and definetely not a 5 star but still one can buy it.,324,3
Needs improvement in stability.,"The packaging and packing was cheap and also not very durable. I have one more which is Gizga product similar to thus, I prefer that is better or Portronics. You hardly use mobile stand so don't fall for it. Go for a better and sturdy design.",10,3

Good buy,"After using the product for more than 4 months I can say that the product is good in terms of serving the purpose however, one of the small flip stopper on the right broke the moment I opened it 2 days ago. Like everyday I flipped it and it broke on that day. Nothing can be done to it, it was attached to the main unit, it is non-removable.
Thus, I can say that the quality of the plastic is questionable and doesn't seem to be long lasting.",Helpful,3
Lightweight,"The unit on a whole is a good unit, designed well, stable, no issues it terms of load bearing, comfortably holds any working class laptop, there is a sense of wobble if the laptop is Alienware or beyond but not a product flaw those gaming laptops are generally very heavy.
However the issue is with the clamps and the edge which prevent the laptop from tipping over, barely used for a month and the class broke off. The quality of the fixture in the clamp is very poor. It chips off with ease. Still functional but the clamp quality requires to be changed as it is an issue.",Helpful,3
Too small for 15.6 inch laptop,"1. You can't use the mobile holder (USP of this product) while using the stand in flat mode as it requires the holder to be in lifted mode. So it becomes useless in such case.
2. Also, as the mobile holder is detached (separate) from the stand so you have attach and remove it every time and have to keep it separately and safely.
3. Moreover, attaching and removing the mobile holder is also not a very smooth process and so has the chances of breaking down.",Helpful,3
ok product,"First impression is good..
Suitable for long hours usage of laptop ..
Suitable for specific laptop designs
My main problem faced is..
1.It blocks the heat dissipation holes of my laptop which may affect the heat dissipation
2. Not suitable for my laptop because my laptop design for heat dissipation is placed at top bottom side of the laptop, so this stand is not suitable for my laptop..

Overall for other users it may be perfect which should used while little care",Helpful,3
Not the best - Gizga is better,"The main problem for me is that this stand is still too low for me. My family members are all close to 6ft tall and it was not tall enough for them.

Lazy Amazon,"It is not properly packed, the address and detail were pasted in the box, without any separate packaging or invoice.
Moreover the stand is pretty small for a 15.6' laptop.
The minimum angle is also around 45° extended to about 90°. Sometime we just want our laptops to be slightly slant than its normal position which is not possible with this stand because even if u keep it at minimum angle, the laptop goes high up. I am not satisfied with it, don't know about others.",Helpful,2
Not of a good quality,"Product is misrepresented in the visuals. Look at the image carefully, it indicates that the stand can be flexed at an angle. This leads you to believe that you can rest the keyboard on an inclined part of the stand & the monitor on a horizontal part of the stand.

But that is not what the actual product looks like. There is no separate resting point for the monitor. My surface pro has a detachable monitor, which cannot rest on an inclined surface where the key board is placed already. So everytime I keep my keyboard on the incline, the monitor snaps down.

To top it all, these guys do not allow you to return the product, so I am stuck with this useless contraption. Rather sad! Guys, please be honest and show the product as it is! Do not mislead customers.",Helpful,2

It is quite strong the wire is reinforced with nylon thread the overhead with stainless steel.could be used while exercising and walking without worrying about damaging it. It has option to switch on/off the microphone which come handy when the phone is in the pocket and you are attaining a meeting. Only con is due to steel plate in the overhead it can cause pressure around the ears when it was new, but after 2 weeks no issue.",Helpful,1
Worst & pathetic product,"Hey! (It's a long review but read till end to understand 😂)
The earcups are so comfortable and Soft. The size of the earcups are also big enough to cover the whole ear.
First of all the sound quality is good but not Amazing. The bass and treble is normal , nothing specific like high end ones.
But in PC with few Bass boost frequencies changes it turns out to be a Beast!!.
For playing games and Listening music you can increase bass.
And for YouTube or watching movies you can disable bass and increase clearity(treble)!!
Over all its a worth buy below 1k
That's it .
Thank You!

Good Quality product,"It is a really underrated product. I got mine pretty fast. It has awesome build quality. I wanted to buy a budget headphone and I finally found it. Fells like nothing when you wear it. Sound quality is just god level and noise cancellation is also pretty good.
I only thing I dought is that the on-off switch for mic can break.",2,5

Awesome product.must buy,"Aaaamazing!!! Better than expected, I usually expect more lol. Seriously nothing can beat this. Best in budget !! Noise cancelation is awesome, 8/10. Volume control is good 7/10 as it gets loose after few months of use. Sound quality is 10/10, Bang On!! The only con of this headset is its too tight to use in the initial days of usage. But with more use and time it gets as you want. So OVERALL 9/10 for this headset.
Oh wait about mic, it's 8/10 I like how I can twist it, bend it, rotate it any way I want. This is super. I usually keep the mic's hole side towards the outer side, i.e. not facing my face. Haha. As it prevent the phuss phuss sound of air coming from mouth .. lol.",One,5
OK good,"I bought this headset for my office calls. I am not a fan of over the head headsets. So bought the over the head for first time. Look and quality is superb. The cable is long, braided and feels sturdy(little heavy for me). Surrounding noise cancellation is good, mic is good. I felt little heavy on back side of ear, because of its curved shape. I don't think it will be good for long use. When I use for calls more than 1 hour I am feeling little discomfortable.",6,5
Amazing 1,"Its a nice headset, good sound quality and also the microphone works good too. But i highly recommend using a proper microphone. If you are streaming or something like that. Bear in mind tho that if your ears are a little bigger than the earcaps then this might hurt. I use this for like 6-7 hours a day it hurts a little after taking ot off. Now the microphone-
This mic is very good, the end users can clearly hear what i am saying and stuff like that. Also i use this to play games like Valorant and CSGO where communication is important. Amd my teammates can hear me very clearly. But there is no background noise cancellation thingy in this. Overall this is a must buy if you are on a budget. I Approve
Comfort:- 4.2/5
Sound quality:-4.8/5
Microphone:-4.8/5
Also note i bought this for like 800Rupees
Buy this during a sale or something but by that time you will have enough money to buy another headset :)",One,5
Just go for it.....,"Nice built quality, sound quality good in the price range of 800 but sound pops out clearly...

Good product for office use as well,"I have been using this headphones for quite a while now and the style on this headphones is so good, the audio quality is averagely good but the microphone is not best but it’s some what good.

And your ears might hurt after abt 40 min of no stop use.

This is a game changer!!,"Comfortable fit, good noise cancellation, but too much bass. It's also advisable to use them in an environment with adequate air conditioning or good cooling (which I don't have) else you'll end up with sweaty ears even after 10 min of use.

Excellent design and quality,"Packaging was poor but headsets are good enough for the price I got these for 799. Have a good cable. There are better ones available.

1. Sound Clarity. You can clearly Judge where the enemy is coming from.

2. Mic's Noise cancellation is not good enough. People hear lot of background noise while u are using these headphones.",2,4

I was little skeptical whether I should buy this table or not..... but Its REALLY AMAZIN... Quality is awesome...

In perfect condition.. no issues. Brand new,"It is sturdy, lightweight and durable. The table finishing is also good but only that the plastic parts used aren't of that good quality and finish. Plus the cup holder and tablet holder plastic is removable (contrary to whats given in product details). Either you can keep it that way or glue it by yourself. The leg sturdiness is excellent, the table won't shake or wobble while writing on it. The table top side finishing is also excellent. The other slight problem is of that slider drawer, it is not that consistently smooth and neither of good quality. One more thing, the table top will get hand prints easily (especially if it's a dark shade) with your wet or oily hands nd will not look that clean after using.",2,5
Attractive product in this range,"Quite sleek and easy to move around the house. The beading around the board is sleek and useful. Top board laminate colour is different from that shown on Amazon but attractive.

The only thing is, I don't think the plastic pull out drawer underneath will last. Also, the cup holder's depth is inadequate and a cup/ tumbler/ bottle placed in it can easily tip over.",3,5
Crafted Elegantly,"I ordered the combo (table with a mobile holder). The table is quite good -- not too heavy, easily foldable, good finish, and with removable spaces to hold a glass and a tablet. The drawer is adequate and can hold stationery and other knick-knacks. I find the handle quite useful as it's easy to carry the table with one hand. The only issue I find with the table is that it's wobbly because of its rounded legs. I use it on my bed, so I have to place the laptop in such a way that the table doesn't tip over. The mobile holder is quite useless. Its cord is inflexible and it's difficult to place the phone in an orientation of your choice. Overall, go for it if you don't mind it being slightly wobbly.",Helpful,5
Excellent Portable Workstation,"Like every product it also have some pros and cons
Pros . Sturdy enough,light in weight but not too light ,regulated movement of legs you can adjust it ,drawer provided for computer accessories, spacious top ,nice space for cup , a space for tab and pen also
Cons. Its height can't be adjusted , cooling fan is not there",Helpful,5
Worth the price and great product.,"I have bought three such bed desks till now. Trust me this one takes the cake. The anti slips are rigid and does the work. The optional drawer is alright. The quality of this product finally feels worth every penny. Loved this purchase.

I took away one star cause the tablet lid was not attached. But that happens, the product quality is quite satisfying.
Recommended",31,4
Missing Warranty card,"The foldable table is lightweight and compact and thus can be easily stored in a small space. It has a sleek finish and looks great. The drawer comes handy when you want to store stationery or other items of use that you might need while working. This saves time and effort and also makes the work easier. The macbook/phone holder is also a great addition which helps to place your device safely. The coffee cup holder may be useful, however I found it redundant.

The space provided could have been a bit larger. If this table is bought for official work while using a laptop or as a breakfast table for patients, the space is enough. However as a study table, with many books and notebooks to keep, the space should have been a bit more. Maybe, if you do not keep a coffee cup on the table and utilise the space judiciously, it can serve the purpose.

Overall, it's an ergonomic product, with an appealing look. The only drawback that I found was the stability. When writing on the notebook, the base of this table shakes a bit, which can disrupt the work. Whether it's placed on the bed or on the floor, the case is same. The constant vibratory movements might lead to bad handwriting. I would have liked it better if the footing was more stable and didn't shake. Also, it could have been a bit higher or atleast the height should have been adjustable.

Overall, it's good to go and can be considered if you are looking for a good looking foldable table at a reasonable price.

Thanks for reading!",11,4
Overall good product except for the plastic part finishing.,"After unboxing, the first impression was good. Got in a good condition & a nice finished product. Usefull for the purpose. Quality wise seem to be good. Stability and sturdiness are more than average rating. Screws are well fitted with the stands but the plastic parts might not be outstanding, so might need to handle with care to last long. Overall it's a good product. So, a good deal to buy.

👍Recommending it for buying.",6,4
Handy and decent product.,"It sturdy and the quality is good but the problem is, it’s very difficult to use on a bed, because the edges are curvy. It falls down easily. They could have done something about that. The edges could have been flat rather than curvy. The point of buying this laptop table is to be able to use on a bed, it doesn’t serve that purpose.",2,4
"Good, but could be better","The table is light in weight, finish is good. On floor, the rubber grips help give it very good stability. However, on soft surfaces like beds, it tends to tilt very easily because of the rounded corners on legs. Its good enough to place laptop or tablet or phone.",3,4
Recommendable product,worth for ₹450 ..not for ₹799 .. cheating by high price,2,4
Finally a good product,"Two stars deducted from 5 stars because...
• Not large enough, I want to at least have one book or notebook open in front of the laptop while using it. The second pic shows that I can barely fit a laptop and a mouse-mousepad together. NOT BIG ENOUGH ;(
• The drawer is not deep enough. Some brands don't even have a drawer so I appreciate this, but if you had to make one, at least make it deep enough for me to stuff my pencil pouch or something in. The manufacturer could easily keep that in mind. Edit: THE DRAWER IS USELESS. Just take it out.

What I like...
• Color of the sunmica is very good. But I wish the legs were dark gray too.
• The handle cut out on the top, makes it easier for me to carry it while juggling the table and books and laptop at the same time on my way to the comfiest bed.
• Lightweight, big need. I think this one's sturdy enough to last me for 10 years minimum.",One,4
Sleek finish at a good price,"The design is universal and the dimensions are adequate.
The additions of the cup holder and mini slide out tray are delight factors but useful, depending on the purpose for which you have bought it.

Issues to be addressed by the manufacturer:
Please update your quality standards. It will go a long way in building your brand equity, customer satisfaction and consequently grow your business.
You must focus on maintaining quality standards or people will stop buying your product.
The only reason for purchasing this product is the ""Made in India"" tag and to avoid buying China made goods. And the result has me questioning myself.
The top and bottom surface finishing is average, the side beading leaves a lot wanting. The mini trays are not aligned correctly and are not of uniform size or make.
I have ordered this twice, both the times the first table to be delivered was a damaged piece.
The first time around the replacement table was perfect.
My second order was again met with a damaged piece which I had to return and ask for a replacement. Awaiting the delivery of the replacement and will update the review after that.
That goes to say, there are good pieces and not so good pieces.
Either do something to rectify the not so good pieces and sell them as ""refurbished"" at a lower price or if they are beyond salvage, accept them as an operational loss and move on.

Please focus on maintaining quality. It does not have to be at six sigma level. But please ensure that the products going out will bring you good name and business.",Helpful,4
Overall good product," The item is very light weight,so it's not very much stable while using,legs is made of aluminium not iron or heavy material so it can't effort heavy weight.I purchased it for my 7 years baby's study purpose,but not satisfied...It seems that it's not run for long time.Finishing is good,price is high and it's portable easily,and it has fixed height which is ok,but overall product seems not so durable,let's see..",Helpful,4
Good and bad,"Wish the legs were adjustable. The desk should be slanting enough as it is not a normal table.

The laptop design is not comfortable",One,4
"Useful table, Not Bad","The table overall is pretty nice. Looks exactly like shown in the description pictures. The problem is, that my practical purpose isn't completely solved. I bought this table to use on my bed while working. But it isn't stable when used on the bed, and I have to adjust it a lot to find a position where I can type comfortably. Thus, the rating. Otherwise it's a good table to be used in sturdier places like on the floor.
Product body overall is pretty decent. It doesn't seem like it's made of cheaper materials. The cup holder, tab holder might come out of their slots as they're not glued in, but it's not flimsy and doesn't keep falling out all the time. I was expecting some kind of phone number where I could register my product for the warranty, but no such number was present on the box, only an email address was there. So I'm confused how I would claim my warranty, should something go wrong.",209,3
NOT WORTH FOR MONEY ₹799,"Good product for using laptop during work from home. We also use this table for playing cards, cutting vegetables and eating snacks etc. The drawer, though, is not of very strong material and an edge of the drawer was broken soon (good for use but slides out easily now). The rounded edges have 4 Anti-Slip Sponges. They were comfy and stable until 4 months. But recently, after 4 months of use, the sponges are torn and the table frequently falls down whenever we move it sideways. But we can't replace only the sponges. If they are replaceable free of cost, it would be great.",31,3
"Not Large Enough, Drawer Not Deep Enough","I have rated it at 3 stars. Firslty, because of one misleading info and where it is shows as the cupholder and tablet holder are not detachable, which is completely false..these holders are detachable. Secondly, there are few quality control issues like a screw is missing for the drawer section, color is chipped off at two places (knit picking) and holders are loosely fitted.",24,3
Quality control needs to be improved,"I have used this product for almost 3 months now. The product is light weight and hence easy to fold and carry. The drawer on the side is good for storing small stationary items. However, the round edged legs of the table make it tumble over if uneven weight is put on the table which is it's biggest disadvantage. So in case you want to put food or drinks on it, be aware! The material quality is average as the plastic belt around the table is low quality and is fixed with adhesive. Overall, an average quality product for an average price.",6,3
"Can be use for short period,not so stady",Firstly the design is not that good.. the legs designed to fall either ways if the weight of the laptop is not balanced to the centre.. if its kept on bed or soft surfaces and if the laptop is not placed at the exact centre its sure to fall back.. also the placement of tab holder cup holder are not suitable if you have a 15 inch laptop.. i have removed all that to place the laptop.. also the table top attracts dust like hell.. just one night if you place it anywhere and the next day both the laptop and the table top is covered with lots of dust.. i will be giving 4/10 for the purchase..,5,3

"Okay product, wobbles when used on bed","The table is quite spacious and well made. Edges are nicely rounded and the slot for cups is also ideal. Drawer is also good enough for placing stationary and other nick-nacks.
But the table has a major balance issue. When placed on bed and a 15 inch laptop placed over it, it takes effort to hold it from not toppling over. If you are going to use it on flour though, you won't have such issue.",2,3
Honest review after 4 months - good table but sponge edges are torn, No sturdiness at all.. I am returning this table as it is not good to use for work from home person. If you will keep your arms by chance on it then everything on the table will topple on you..,4,3
Good table with some misleading info and some quality issues,"Even though I titled as after an year of usage, I didn't use a lot as this is a crappy product. It is light weight but not stable. It will fall over with the laptop because this is too unstable. The rubber in the bottom made it only worse.

Please look for someother product and test your luck but this is a crappy one and you will regret it.

I am writing this review only because my brother who used this table just called me and asked the link today, because he want to make he won't buy this one because he is looking for a table in Amazon.",Helpful,3
Average Quality Product," Product is good, but manufacturer must change C shaped curved design of base (edges) to make table stable and useful. It's joints are of plastic material which may be improved. Plastic fixtures like cup holder and tablet holder shall be parmanently fixed with adhesive. These changes will definitely makes your product perfect and most popular. I am adjusting with this asoff now but it irritates. Please take these feedback in positive way for benefits of all of us.",Helpful,3
It serves the purpose but not upto the mark,"Ergonomics of the desk are good..but for the price point the quality could have been better. The edge provided around the table is finished very poorly as the two ends are not stuck properly..it is definitely an eye sore. The major problem for me was the way the desk is packed..no safety cover for table top which causes scratches, on both occassions the packaging box was damaged where the leg part is portruding out of the box. I had to return twice as both times table top had scratches, chipped around the corner. Not happy with the product.",35,2
OK Product,"The table base is not stable, bcoz of the curvy edges its very osilate while working! i opt for refund but unfortunately i get the replace with the same product will see how the next one will be!",6,2
Balance issues,"The cup holder is on the right and the drawer is on the left. Opposite of what is shown in the Pic.
Thw white edge is hard plastic. Not comfy. I tore away the white plastic edge
On the bed not very stable but acceptable",2,2
No sturdiness at all,"The rubber isn't of good quality, only the wooden ply is good otherwise other parts are of low quality. Within 1- 2months the conditions of table has degrade. It's not long term thing which can be kept. Now atpresent it can't be replaced or repaired. So think before purchasing.",Helpful,2
Review after an year usage,"Not great for the purpose. Bad rubber used for stability on the leg rungs (feels plasticky). Not stable for using as a bed table for laptop as it is flimsy and topples easily - even for lighter weight laptops like MacBook Pro.
Bad design overall.",Helpful,2

Doesn't look like shown,"Not at all worth the price! Thinking of return. Tab & Cup Holders are very loose and gets detached very easily. Very Unstable & can easily flip over on one side.

Even for a slightest application of pressure or weight, it tends to flip over! Very Bad finishing! ""A BIG NO"" for this product!!",Helpful,2
Not Satisfactory product,The nails are very superficially plugged into the table. The section that holds the small drawer came off within a week. The stand on one side has also came off. When we tried to attach it the screw keeps going around. The threads of the screws are not proper. The table is useless now. I had bought it in july and itt is only august and the table is broken. The return window has been closed too. Positives are that the table is light weight. Can be moved around easily.,Helpful,2
Bad finishing and can topple,"Beware of this product. They used to sell the table as advertised however the tables I received in last two order from this vendor was complete disappointment. The quality of make is deteriorated completely, no finish, loose cup holder and tab holder which keeps falling off, the tray has scratches all over and misaligned. All in all bad purchase.

Below is my old review for the table that they used to sell. I am keeping as is to highlight the difference between the product that this vendor used to sell and selling now.

I have already placed return request for the last table I received.

"Shakes a lot , Design flaw","Since this table has round legs as shown in the attached picture, it is not standing still. It is always rotating. Your laptop will fall down from the table.

Seller is not trusted,Well as per the description of the product it is good but when the product is delivered. It is totally otherway round. Don't go with the products.its not at all worth.waste of money .The most horrifying thing is that the product does not match with his description at all. I would recommend a big no to the product.,8,1
Useless,I don't know how this product got so many positive reviews. It's wobbly on flat surface. Weight balance is bad if you press a little on the front side it flips forward. The cup holder and mobile holder are both loose and not stuck to the table. There is no return only exchange is available and I am sure these issues would still be present in the exchanged piece. Just go and buy the same table that is available for 400 on Amazon itself atleast your lose would be less. This is not worth 800inr.,6,1
Unstable & Bad Quality Product! Not worth the price!,"When I got the product, it was not the same as what was displayed in the item image description - the cup holder was to the right (not much place for mouse), the drawer and table holder are to the left, which is inconvenient and not intuitive at all.

Durable and Perfect Small Keyboard.,"Fantastic product. The build quality is superb to say the least. The wire is sufficiently long as well as strong (very thick - almost 3mm thick). This is the thickest wire I have seen on any headphone. The jack is durable and will withstand the test of time.
The voice clarity is excellent (A+++). I am not using it for gaming but for vocal recordings on a popular karoake app. The headphones also provide superb voice quality. Overall a very nice product which I will recommend highly to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a Great price.
Another feature which I like is the additional volume control in-built into the wire.
Thank you",Helpful,4
Superb 👍,"This is a good headphone. I had purchased from the market three times and each time they broke the same way, while I was removing the headphone off my head the ear muff broke .. lol! I think my head swells with too much pride when I work ... rofl! anyways as I am a medical transcriptionist and a good headphone is a must and my old headphone is only for use as a crisis stopgap I went to Amazon website and purchased this one. Sound quality is good. You can have good Skype conversations also. The wire to attach to the CPU is long so no bending your head to the left/right so you can do your work ... All in all for the price a good purchase and also nice designs. I bought the Army grey colour one. It's cool. Thumbs up to this product! :)",One,1
Worst and Cheep Class Product,"This is really cool man I just loved it....
I'm using it for my PS4 PRO and I wanted to go for vibration headphones but there's no 3.5mm jack to connect it to my dualshock 4....
There's option for USB too but I need to go the console for using it so connecting it to my dualshock 4 would be in handy rather than to go near my console.
The sponge/cushion/foam for the head is as soft as a feather and didn't expect that it would be of that premium quality...
My concern is that it would have been the best if it would be wireless coz it's hanging from the headphones like running nose..
Overall its a good product, I would recommend to all gamers to go for it...",134,5
Gives us the perfect clarity,"Bought it On 15th may 2018. N still working good. Long wire which is a benefit to me. Mic quality is really awesome.
Headphones made contact with water plenty of times..one time it's volume controller was left dipped in a glass of water for a whole night. Then in morning i put it in a bag of rice n it works as fine as before. Water made contact with the mic too but didn't damaged it. Works really good. Sound quality really good. It is slightly changed then before but not that much. Good bass. N perfect for gaming. Really comfortable for ears. Padding is really soft n durable. Happy for this purchase.",57,5
Perfect for mobile gaming,"I have owned overhead/inear ranging from 500-20k. At this price range, this is beast, it couldn't just get better. The bass is nice, there is clarity though I wish the base wasn't overpowering the voice certain number of times, thats fine as that can be adjusted in the equalizer.

The headphone is big but doesn't feel bulky while wearing as its lightweight, looks durable and sturdy. Cushions make it comfortable to use it for a long time.

Feedback for the maker: If you plan to upgrade this model maybe try to use a higher quality wire.

Dont think twice to go for it.",83,5
Bang for the Buck!!,"Pro: Good sound quality

Fantastic Product,"I love this headset. I've been using it for over a year. The mainly purchased it for official calls and meetings. However, it works really well when I need to listen to music or watch movies. The microphone picks up audio really well. Mics broke off on my older headsets because they used to be separate. But, on this one, I've not had that issue because once the mic is folded, it's a part of the headset and is not protruding out.
This might be the right choice if you are an audiophile. If you are normal user who wishes to listen to music and use it for calls, it's the best at the price range.",16,5

SOUND.BASS.DURABILITY AT CHEAP PRICE,"According to my personal taste i liked this a lot.
This is my 2nd headphone. Move to the 3rd para for direct reveiw. Writing the reveiw after using it for 2 months.

My first one was Boat bassheads 900, that heaphone is awesome their customer support is way too better but that was not comfortable for using nore than an hour.
Recently i bought Hyper X cloud 2, and thats out of bodget for max of us, but they hadnt compromised on anything about that, a complete satisfaction on that item. So basically i use

I have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.

If you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.

DEMERITS:
Personally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.
Sound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.

MERITS:
Now lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).
The best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion. And if you are gamer then forget about the demerits i mentioned, beacuse i dont think those demerits even natter for you.",5,5
Dont think twice to go for it.,"Providing the review after 2 month using. Please find the review below

Pros:
1. In this price range this is a good head phone.
2. The padding is very good.
3. This is good for playing pubg. Right left year sound outcome is good.
4. In this headphone you will find a volume button which i found very helpfull as I am using the headphones in Ipad while paying pubg.
5. Now coming to the sound quality. Recording facility is really good. you will get a awesome recording sound with this headphone. You do not need to speak very loudly to get good sound.

Cons:
1. I am deducting one star because of the fitting issue. It is a little tight on head. Even when using it with max length I faced the issue. After playing for 1 hour need to take it off for sometime.",12,5
Good headset at this price range,"I had previously owned this headset, the 3.5 jack cable snapped with rough use and eventually, the mic just gave up. I had used this roughly for 1.5 years so wasn't really disappointed. So with the latest purchase, I knew exactly what I was getting for the price. descent mic, long sturdy cable. I use this mainly for attending calls and video conferences. Its VFM, mic quality is pretty good, the only downsides I would say are - it's no big head approved, and their ear cushions are not comfortable for long hours of usage.",4,5
Worth it!,"Nice Sound but not comfortable..
[Got them @15/SEP, writing this review after 1 month @16/OCT]

1. Sound and Mic [5/5] - The sound and mic quality is really so awesome! Since it sounds sooo damn great, NO PAIN inside the ears; and no need to scream for your voice to get delivered.

2. Build [5/5] - They are very stylish and look very cool! They are sturdy and hard enough to survive few shocks, padding is also soft. The wire and connector are also of awesome quality. Wire is very long.. so no problems in that!

3.Comfort [2/5] - They are really a bit bulky and stick very hard on the ears.
You are really going to feel pain on your ears, neck and head; if you are a medium to heavy user, but as time passes you will get more used to it. or you can just put a lot of books between them so that it can stretch as much as it can and not hurt you!

4. Compatibility [5/5]- No issues. Everything as stated.
For connecting with desktop, you need an audio splitter to split it into 2 Male Pins.
Which is quite obvious because single pin headphones don't connect to PC directly, or if u connect them to the sound one, then you'll not be able to use the mic, pretty easy to understand!

Summary of Review-
Loved the headphones, seeing the price, they are really value for money!
Deducted 1 star because of less comfortability.

Would I recommend it?
Yes, I would surely do! they are extremely value for money because of their mic, sound, style and braided cable.

Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth reading this!

Awesome GAMING headphone under 1000.,"I have been using this headphone for some time now.. i ise it daily for my office calls on teams and skype.
Pros :
Good design - looks pretty cool
Sound button on headset is an added advantage
Extended mic is awesome
Sound quality is good
Breaded cord is good quality

Cons :
After using it for half an hour, my ears start paining. This is mainly because of ear cup design is not good for ears, i think the cushion on eardrums looks soft but its not soft enough to comfort ears for more then half hour. Because of this i am giving it only 4 stars.",422,4
Can be used with PC and PS4,"I play multiplayer games where sound cue could make or break your round/match. These headphones have really improved my sensitivity to such sounds and I've been able to perform slightly better in my games.

However, if you plan to watch movies /listen to music on these headphones and it's an important element for you to consider then I suggest looking elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, you can totally watch movies or listen to music on this but the quality might not be up to your liking. I am satisfied with it.",33,4
Heavy and Bold looks. But take ur time to get the details,"The product is fine with respect of its price. 699 is what i got for and the lowest it goes during sale.

Pros
The sound quality is good
No distortion while using on full volume ( depends on the song if it has more bass then there will be distortion with full volume )
The sound signature is good, the mids and highs are impressive with the low end being high making this perfect for gamimg and music
This is perfect for gamers and music listeners

Cons
The headset is not so comfy on my ears ( although do note that my ears are big and if your ears are small you wont have any problem )

Sound - 5/5
For gaming - 100/5
For music - 4/5
Mic quality - 5/5
Material - 4/5 not cheap but not too expensive
Overall - 4.8/5

Worth a try and its a really good headphone",20,4
Good purchase in this price range,"The sound clarity is good, you can literally listen to songs by keeping the volume upto 90%. For gaming you can probably keep it to 60-80% depending on your preference. Sound quality is sharp and while playing games like pubg you can hear the footsteps quite clearly. The mic does a decent job, its not the best but for the low price you cant ask for anything better. You can go for it. Its quite heavy too compared to other headphones we normally use.",Helpful,4
descent headset for the price,"Both sound and mic voice clear enough. I can hear long distance footsteps easily in Apex, PUBG, etc. But it's not comfortable for me. I need to take it out every 30 min or less. I found it has a very small space ear space (you guys can see egg space) that why it gets hurt if I wear it for a long time. And I don't know either that I'm the only one facing a comfortable issue.

I'm thinking to return it but again I like sound quality. Man, what to do....?",2,4
"Nice Sound, not very comfortable","Writing this review after a year of usage. Headphone is good for gaming or i would say best headphone in this price range but when it comes to durability, it doesn't last more than 5 to 6 months. Sound quality degraded, volume level reduces after few months of uses, ear cups torns out as shown in the picture and lots of static noicse coming out from headphone jack. I have played lots of pubg mobile matches using this headphone, it performs well in the beginning, it gives exact location and footsteps of enemy but at the end, there exist a term called durability which this headphone doesn't really poses. If you're a hardcore gamer, this headphone isn't for you but if you can consider the durability, you can go for it. Hence, 3 stars.",Helpful,4
Good.. but could be awesome. Ears paining.,"no idea why 7k people have given such good reviews just to mislead people,maybe because this comes with a 3mm audio jack and fits most devices instead of the typical usb style which other gaming headsets come with. out of the box the product looked cheap quality.i kid you not compare it with redgear cosmic 7.1 that comes with in this range.i have rough used many times but it had a metal headband,braided wires with extra protection wrapped inside a plastic casing and the cushions were the most comfortable. after 3years of dropping it many times stretching the wires by mistake etc etc. it finally had an issue on one side with a small malfunction on the connecting wires. but I thought I'll buy another brand because it was a bit heavier on the head because of all the extra cushioning etc and also the mic was disturbance most of the time. so I saw this with so many good reviews and looked light weight and also the mic can be hidden.

but biggest mistake of my life.this is just crap infront of it. with quality (full of cheap plastic.i dunno if it will survive a drop)and audio too is not that great. I regret the purchase.",3,4
Worth it if you are a gamer !!,"Purchased it for office calls. Mic clarity is excellent and eliminates few (not all) background noises compared to normal bluetooth headphones. Audio quality is good. Only con is after 1 hrs my ear starts paining.

Note: This appears to be the case only with the laptop (tested with 3 of them) . With the phone, the mic seems all right so there is some issue with mic gain / pickup I guess.

Delivery and service are excellent though.",19,3
Sound quality is clear enough but it's not comfortable for me.,"Hi. I write this review about 1 month after buying the product. The plastic model, the wires are all good, sound is also good. The on/off along with volume control box is the only big problem. Although useless, the on/off switch stopped working 2 days after I bought it, which is no big deal, but the highest volume of the headphone is available only if I use the product while the switch is off(it's possible by first plugging it, then on then pushing it to off while plugged in) which is crap. It should be at highest volume without any of this. Otherwise, a solid product for it price. 👍😋",7,3
Durability.,"Don't buy these headphones, I've used these for about a year and a half now, it's good for the price, but trust me, it's much better to save up and go for 2500-4000 headphones. Some of the problems I've faced are:

(i) Peeling of the red-colored fabric on the cushions which will expose the white cushion which turns to brown from dust very fast, the stylish game'ish feels will turn into a homeless man feel very fast (refer to attached pic)
(ii) Not comfortable if u have large ears, it will compress your ears and create pain, ive used it for a year so im used to it but would not recommend.
(iii) Requires an external splitter if u wana use the mic on the desktop
(iv) Audio quality is very poor but its playable (turn on loudness equalization in windows settings or you cant even hear footsteps) reached gold nova master in csgo and sound was not the thing holding me back
(v) Not suited for songs or movies, the audio is very washed out and bass is nonexistent",Helpful,3
4stars for this !!,"Pros: Clarity and sound amplify ability at least by 1.5 times the normal is absolutely great

Cons: Since the volume adjust button is given on the left side of the cable, after 30 mins or more, it gives neck pain on the left side,

Note: If volume adjust button is some where else except on the cable, this is a great device",Helpful,3
Using it for office calls,"I like the product. I've been using it for my phone and it's pretty good. Especially, I love the mic on it. It sounds sharp and is great for calls and meetings! I've only had a good experience on my phone though because for PC it requires a splitter cable for audio and mic which I think is the only bad thing about this headset. Would recommend for mobile devices but for pc, I would say buy another one or get a splitter cable. Also, the cable is of poor quality quality, it can be easily cut/damaged.",11,3
NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS,"Great sound , comfortable , but 3,5 mm plug is SO bulky !! hence , when we play 3,4 finger claw , the Plug is giving huge discomfort !!! hence, after just 5 days use : lost stereo, random self unplugging while gaming , have to replugg all time ( facing all audio phone set up on screen to readjust while action gaming ) ....Impossible to enjoy anymore after less than 25 hours use !!! waste of Money ...should have a smart small 3,5 plug ...rest is super good ....",One,3
Mic not adequate for a laptop,"Bought these for taking calls, but unfortunately there's nothing great in them except the voice clarity. Highly uncomfortable for big head people and doesn't sit well on earlobes.
I could have given one more star but even the sound quality is not upto the mark, listening to songs is a complete no no....I am not sure about the other reviews regarding the gameing since I am not one, but if you are taking this as an all rounder than definitely not a good choice.",Helpful,3
Very good if the volume regulating box wasn't there,"See the product in itself is fine and you might find it quite decent at first, but after using this for more than 2 months i am writing this review. I ordered this for gaming/discord purposes and for a month it worked fine, until one day one side of the headphone stopped working altogether! it did fall off by bed once but not from much height. Overall i would say its decent till its working but i am pretty sure it will not work more than 2-3 months.

-long usage for 1 hour or more really does start to pain in the ear.
-Microphone on/off button was not working since the start (mic worked fine thou).
-Build quality is good and sturdy although ill warn you they are really quite big, doesn't really looks good on head (pointed out by many many people).

If you really just want to flaunt the design of the headset its nice, (i have just hung it in the room now :p) or else i would strongly suggest all you guys who wants a gaming headphones, to save a bit more money and not go for cosmic byte in general.",2,3

Good device with a diminutive glitch,"Im giving two starts because of plastic quality and generous use of cushion. The box came in unsealed condition in a bubble wrap all the corners of the box and lid of the box is bent and worn off. Looks like its been returned multiple times to seller already.

Build quality

Price
Cons:
Sound quality
Mic quality

These headphones are very budget friendly for its specs, but that's because they have many problems.
The sound quality is definitely lacking. Low even when compared to my cheaper earphones.
But the main problem I faced is the mic was not working, or having very high noise. Totally unusable.
I would recommend you to either increase your budget for a higher quality headphones, or buy a quality earphones for same range.",One,2
Nothing great except mic...,"There is nothing special about sound quality

Not a very good product. (do read this),"Well where should I start ok from good things

The product is good but it is expected to not work after long time , the sound produced is ok not good sometimes you can feel differences in both side

The delivery is too slow and in my case the headphone is not working after 7 months , customer service told to contact the company, the company is tooooo slow and you have to wait too long , now I asked for replacement and its 3rd day when they agreed too , they are telling to send the headphone to them or might they will come and take it and after 2 to 3 days they will get them , then they will check weather they are having problems or not than I think after 10 to 15 days u will get them , I wouldn't recommend you this headphone at all",4,2
Sound is too low... Can't hear a footstep when approaching towards you...,"You can buy this headsets as use and throw one, because after a couple of months the sound stops comming or decreases from either side. So kinda weird but sound quality is absolutely awesome either for gaming or for music, i am a heavy gamer and the most basic thing which a gamer needs is clear audio with noice cancellation so these headsets are best for starting.

I wouldn't recommend this,The mic stopped working in a month. No warranty or support. Now i'm stuck with this useless pair of flimsy headphones. This is sad. Please invest on some other quality headphones who offers you after sales support,Helpful,2
Neither too good nor too bad,Dont purchase this by seeing all the postitive reviews. Most of them seem to never haver used a proper earphone or headphone. My elearphones have better audio quality than these headphones and they only cost Rs100 more. The audio quality is so pathetic that you will never be able to pinpoint the exact location of gun fire or footsteps,228,1
***Worst Product***DO NOT BUY***,"I've used these headphones for a month now and that's more than enough time to tell if they're bad.... or bad! The build isn't very durable, the audio quality has decread drastically over the past few days, (sounds distorted/static). Microphone is below average. In-game the only thing my teammates hear is the dog barking in the ground-floor, and I was on the terrace. Tried turning off audio enhancements, but it didn't make a difference. I wasn't sent a defective product. They worked fine the first week or so.

Conclusion:
For the price it's understandable, but it could be better. If you respect your ears then don't buy this product.",46,1
Not for gaming,"Bought it because I had a specific need for volume control since my smart TV doesn't let me change the volume when a headphone is connected. The highest volume these headphones provided compares to the default volume on my boat earphones when I connected it to my TV.
Thankfully I can return it since it doesn't meet the purpose.
However the sound is clear and it's okay enough for gaming purpose.

Also, I didn't get the user manual with it which isn't necessary for a pair of headphones but is necessary to know about the use of the package. I feel like I was given a returned piece, which is really annoying.",31,1
Replacement,"The quality of this product is worst, during only 4 weeks of use, the jack pin broke inside the tab midway. Was difficult to take out broken part of jack pin. On reporting this damage to the manufacturer being due to poor quality and a manufacturing defect, they simply washed their hands by saying that it's a damage and is not covered under warranty. I fail to understand if a jack pin breaks midway into the tab, then why it can't be accepted by manufacturer as it's manufacturing defect of product.

1 Star rating is given to add the review otherwise it should be -10.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO PURCHASE ANY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THIS BRAND.",22,1
sound quality is crap and U must have splitter,"It's a classic cheap crap. Purchased on 7th August and the microphone stopped picking up anything at all today, on 31st.

Update: They replaced the product and that Mic stopped working in another 4 months. So in less than 6 months, the model broke twice. Buy a ₹60 earphone from roadside hawkers, but not this.

I suggest seller puts in more cushioning material to avoid any damage to laptop. The laptop takes a little longer to boot and to shut down despite SSD. The plastic used for main body is good. The laptop is running well so far. The battery lasts from 3 to 4 hours depending on what you are doing on it. The keyboard layout is far better than that of HP but can’t understand why num keys are there on a gaming laptop. Overall a good laptop.

Budget gaming laptop,"I bought this laptop recently and am having a hard time using the same.
This laptop has some serious limitations:
1. The Screen is HAZY and BLURRED at places. The TEXT is not clearly readable and causes eye strains, making it unusable for any basic usage also. I have tried updating the Graphics card driver and changing settings, but nothing works !!
2. Screen has SERIOUS BLEEDING on edges when background is dark. And Lenovo customer care calls this as their DESIGN !!
3. When scrolling the windows start menu items, they are blurred while scrolling and take seconds to render. Even my 10 year old HP Laptop is better than it at this.
To top it all, Lenovo CUSTOMER CARE is PATHETIC. They are not ready to even consider this a problem and send an engineer for onsite visit even though I bought a Premium care support.

gst bill update,"Best Desktop Replacement at this price range. This model has subtle features which give it an edge over other laptops in similar price range:

1. 17 inch FHD screen
Though most screens would be FHD, but hard to find 17 inch screens at around 70k (got it at discount)
2. USB type-C port with DP and charge
Most laptops have a USB-C port but not with display. This has both with Display and Charging and
the port supports 10Gbps speed
3. Ryzen 4800H. 8 cores, 16 threads. Great for me and for anyone who has a lot of tasks running with
a GTX 1650 is good enough. Not for serious gaming, but you shouldn't do serious gaming on laptops
anyway. Good for doing small data experiments.

I really don't care about the rest of the frills like backlit keyboard and such. It has two SSD slots and one of them is occupied by a budget Intel SSD. You can (and should) upgrade to a better SSD and should note a great increase in performance. I do bemoan the lack of a SATA disk slot for extra data storage but there are enough USB 3 ports to compensate for that.

The screen broke down before even a month but the warranty experience was fine and it was replaced. I was circumspect as there have been supply issues worldwide but within a week it was fixed so I'm happy. I have another older laptop from Asus and it's running great still after 3 years so this one's screen was probably just bad luck. I would greatly recommend this model overall.",Helpful,2

Screen needs calibration. Mildly satisfied with it

Speakers are good. Put it on any table. The audio is crystal clear.

Boots up in like 5 seconds.

The WiFi card is a BIG BIG BIG problem.
It disconnects on its own.
Doesn't reconnect after waking up from sleep.
Heard its a very common issue with ROG laptops these days...all having these Wifi 6 Mediatek wifi cards.

RGB lighting is customizable to some extent. A pleasant equilibrium is not difficult to reach.

Does get slightly warm while gaming...even though the graphic card is almost completely useless for gaming.

plus point- max keyboard size, Armory crate, idiotic assistant Cortana that will get probably fixed in future updates.
Cons-

1.)low space. 512 gb ssd isn't enough. For expansion read somewhere else, does it support HDD expansion? Nope. it doesn't. It only has an SSD slot expansion
2.)Laptops lags. Yes, i am facing lags. Might be as i install a torrent downloader.
3.)disappointed in gaming performance. I was playing hitman 2016 offline but got only 25-30 fps without charging. (Note-i know it affects battery but for once i can test it).For normal test, results were not that great as i got only 30-50 fps while charging and using all those fps boosters like turbo in armory crate and geforce max settings. Average fps -39.

After 3 months of Usage.
Never purchase a laptop with gtx-1650.Go for Rtx series by adjusting your budget.
2.)Performance of this laptop is not very good compared to its own specification laptops. Hp pavillion performs better than this in all aspects of gaming and battery. I thought Ryzen 7 was good but its a scam to bait customers. It has 8 core cpu but even after that 6 core Pavillion performs better.

Oh wait about mic, it's 8/10 I like how I can twist it, bend it, rotate it any way I want. This is super. I usually keep the mic's hole side towards the outer side, i.e. not facing my face. Haha. As it prevent the phuss phuss sound of air coming from mouth .. lol.",One,5
Awesome product.must buy,"I bought this headset for my office calls. I am not a fan of over the head headsets. So bought the over the head for first time. Look and quality is superb. The cable is long, braided and feels sturdy(little heavy for me). Surrounding noise cancellation is good, mic is good. I felt little heavy on back side of ear, because of its curved shape. I don't think it will be good for long use. When I use for calls more than 1 hour I am feeling little discomfortable.",6,5
OK good,"Its a nice headset, good sound quality and also the microphone works good too. But i highly recommend using a proper microphone. If you are streaming or something like that. Bear in mind tho that if your ears are a little bigger than the earcaps then this might hurt. I use this for like 6-7 hours a day it hurts a little after taking ot off. Now the microphone-
This mic is very good, the end users can clearly hear what i am saying and stuff like that. Also i use this to play games like Valorant and CSGO where communication is important. Amd my teammates can hear me very clearly. But there is no background noise cancellation thingy in this. Overall this is a must buy if you are on a budget. I Approve
Comfort:- 4.2/5
Sound quality:-4.8/5
Microphone:-4.8/5

Buy this during a sale or something but by that time you will have enough money to buy another headset :)",One,5
Amazing 1,"Nice built quality, sound quality good in the price range of 800 but sound pops out clearly... If you are talking to someone while gaming, people can listen to their voice clearly if they are nearby you... That can be really annoying for gamers who record gameplay at home...",Helpful,5
Just go for it.....,"I have been using this headphones for quite a while now and the style on this headphones is so good, the audio quality is averagely good but the microphone is not best but it’s some what good. You can buy it for general use like gaming, music, online classes(maybe) , and editing, it might be good for gaming but average for music and editing. And your ears might hurt after abt 40 min of no stop use.

Overall it’s kind of a averagely good headphone",18,4
Good product for office use as well,"Ah yes, Well, Not bad for a 700rs Headphone, at least better than earphones, Sound quality is Just as the price is ( I mean to say, Good quality but don't expect it to give you an HQ Sound, it's good, Like good for gaming and all) that's it, But if you have a good budget ie-1200-1500, buy some higher version, this is good for those who can't get an expensive one...",9,4
Good product,"Comfortable fit, good noise cancellation, but too much bass. It's also advisable to use them in an environment with adequate air conditioning or good cooling (which I don't have) else you'll end up with sweaty ears even after 10 min of use.

This is a game changer!!,"Packaging was poor but headsets are good enough for the price I got these for 799. Have a good cable. There are better ones available.

1. Sound Clarity. You can clearly Judge where the enemy is coming from.

Worst product,"I am using Sony Headphones for over 2 years now, which were sufficiently good for me. They got damaged somehow, and new sony wireless headphones costed a whole lot than this headphone so I would've had to buy the wired ones, so went for boat. So I'll be comparing these with Sony wired headphones in the same price range (<2000) (believe me, I've used all variants/models)

Pros:
1. The look: The Black ones that I bought look sick. Fallen in love. If you're a black lover like me, go for boat rockerz 450 instead of 510!🖤

2. Bluetooth: it works crisp. I get range in my whole room and even when I keep the phone in my room and go into another room. Excellent.

3. Price: I got them at ₹1199 at Republic Day sale 2020. Worth it.

4. Aux cable: They provided me the aux cable. Everybody has confusion whether they'll provide or not, but they did to me.

5. Sound Quality : Decent. Nice bass. If you have been using earphones, you'll love these headphones.

6. Noise cancellation: My Sony ones didn't have noise cancellation but these do, and it's awesome.

Cons:
1. I've been using Sony and the sound quality of Sony is better than this.

2. Bass of the sony headphones was way better than these. Believe me these are not at all bad(you'll love them) but if you are coming from Sony or JBL, you'll get a bit disappointed.
3. Latency: If you want to play games with this headphones, you will have to use the AUX cable to do that. Can't play games wireless ly, because the game sound will lag too much, making them unpalatable. I tried PUBG, free fire, call of duty, etc. Nearly all of them. But I'm fine with it really, because when you play games on your phone your phone is in your hand anyway, so use the damn aux cable.
Conclusion: I was getting JBL ones for ₹1999 but didn't go for them because they didn't have aux support. Sony wireless headphones do have it, but they cost a lot more (4000 atleast) so couldn't buy them as well.
If you are ok with spending ₹4000 go with Sony. If you don't really need an aux cable support go with JBL. If you are ok with wired headphones go with Sony wired as they are in the same price range as these.

So at this price range, these are literally the best wireless headphones you can buy. If this is your budget, go for it.
I find these sexier than boat rockerz 510 but I'm a black lover and this is my opinion.
If you found this review helpful, hit a thumbs up and help others.",Helpful,1
Its totally uncomfortable the microphone stops working,"⚫ SOUND QUALITY - Sound quality is amazing for this price and Virtualization is good .
⚫ BASS - Average bass not so good or bad, it lies in the middle .
⚫ COMFORT - Not so comfortable , but it is better than boat rockerz 400 , The ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 .
⚫ CONNECTIVITY - Connecting faster to devices . Range is very good , i didn't face any connectivity loss upto 10m and also it has dual pairing feature . There is an audio latency when playing games and No audio latency when watching videos .
⚫ CONTROLS - It is very easy to control and They have kept multifunctional or integrated controls ( Refer to the booklet provided inside the box ) .
⚫ MICROPHONE - Mic is good, Not as bad as boat rockerz 400 .
⚫ NOISE CANCELLATION - They have used passive noice cancellation , It doesn't not seems to reduce any outside unwanted ambient noises.
⚫ BATTERY - Standby time is amazing as mentioned by the Boat , Charging time takes upto 2 hrs 30 mins .
⚫ BUILD QUALITY AND MATERIAL - They have used good plastic material but the slider for adjusting the size of the headphones is not good , the wire gets popped out when sliding . Pls be careful when sliding . The ear cups and headband cushion is soft and sweat proof , the water gets easily evaporated.
⚫ DESIGN - It features an on-ear design and the ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 . It is light-weight but not a sturdy design , which is not intended for jogging or running purposes . For gym it can be used to do strength or weight training or weight lifiting workouts not for aerobic or cardio workouts . The folding design is amazing for the safety of the headphones , it can be easily folded which is easy to place on the flat surfaces .
⚫ LOOK - Premium look with matte black finish , looks sexy when wearing the headphones .

Very tight headphones,"These are the best you can get for the price of 1399/-
-Sound quality 5/5
Used Both wired and via Bluetooth. (Tested wired on the stock aux of boat 400, also a little less bass on Bluetooth but that's expected)
-Build 4.5/5
Though I trust boAt but the extention of ear cups is via plastic ziplock kind of thing which may lead to early wear and cause headphones to go loose.
-Design 5/5 (Over-ear if you don't have large ears)
Awesome design and form factor and the cups are comparatively more comfortable and larger than boAt 400.
-Inbox contents 4/5
The only drawback here is that there is no aux included like in the previous versions but that's not an issue as it was foretold in item description.

Edit after a month of through usage :-
-Comfort 3.5/5
Will cause sweating and minor numbness or pain after longer usages i.e. watching complete movies etc.

Battery life 5/5
Working as described complete 7-8 hours of backup, needless to say it also charges quickly i.e. within 1.5-2 hours.

Overall best headphones to get at the price range of 1500/- and below, just wait a bit for lightning deal and viola best offer ever.",874,5

It can remain charged for a very long duration. The ear cushions provides a comfy experience. The sound quality is superb. It's noice cancellation allows u to just concentrate and feel the music. It's worth the price I paid. The main thing I bought this is that it had the calling features and it really works. This 🎧 is completely light weight. The product comes with a charger for charging and an aux cable which can be connected directly to the phone if we want as it saves charging. It also has an information manual and a 1 year warranty card. This product is a Must have!!",248,5
Poor material..and good service...,"This is nice one, bass is really great and sound also loud, its like mini home theater on your ears. Completely happy with this. Many not suitable for long listening as theses are on ear headphones.

Manufacturer package box is perfect. Thanks to Boat",91,5
Premium look and super comfy," Buy from Flipkart. If u want to know why than read my review!!

Very good for the Price i got it for that is just 999 rupees. I would say to wait for its price to drop from 1499/- to 999/- cause i feel this product is not worth more than 999/-. Its bass is pretty good for 999. But its not earth shaking bass.. Average bass.. But best, no not best, i would say top notch sound quality. Very good product from boat. Value for money only 999/- then. But i dont think this is a durable product only because the plastic in it's adjustable head band part is of cheap quality unlike its body. Its body is made up of high quality smooth matt finish plastic and some parts rade of rubber like material. Not comfortable for movies. Ears pain if worn for more than 1 hour. Ear cushion and head band padding is adequate not astonishing but. But its just worth 999 so cant except much. Battery life is as said, 15hours. I watched a movie of 3hours and only 20% of battery got used. Charges in about 2-3 hours. But it is very small, not suitable for people with big heads, (not 🤓 nerds) 😂...Aux cable is cheap quality n very thin but sound quality is good, usb cable is very cheap quality, i dont even use it,Aux cable length is 150 cms and usb cable is 80cms in length. Very dissapointed but as the seals of the box were tampered. 😡😡😡😡😡😡Very bad seller approach. Maybe he opened them and listened a song and when he got bored he packed it and sent to me😑😏😏. Buy from flipkart instead and avoid tampered products. I kept cause i needed it urgently and it was fine without any physical damge or mechanical errors. Finally i would say. Go for it folks. Its a great deal. Note:Do not buy from Appario seller on Amazon. . Thanks for reading my review :)😉😆😆

Have a great day ahead Folks!👍👍👍",64,5

BOAT ROCKERZ 450 ( 7/10 ),"Rockerz 450 is my Second Headphone from boAt, other being Rockerz 510.

+ Packing - Comes in a great packing which looks good and easy to unpack
+ Design - This is a good looking headphone with a cute Circumaural design (not that big as Rockers 510). Graphics over the ear cups is just nice. When I rub my hands over the cups and I could feel the quality of the material. I was late to notice that the cups can be rotated to 180 degrees.
+ Comfort - Smaller headphone when compared Rocker 510, still the cups are large and soft enough to impart a Cozy feeling.
+ Sound quality - I am using this one for general listening as well as editing my YouTube videos, and the sound quality is good enough for me.
+ Volume and Playback Controls - Playback and volume control on the rear side of ear cup lets you skip tracks and adjust the volume.
+ Bluetooth - Connectivity is just great. I am able to move within all rooms of a 1500 sqft Floor.
+ Battery Life - I recharge the headphone once in 2 days after using it for 7 to 8 hours with intermittent intervals.
+ Economic when compared with other brands in this segment.

- Noise cancellation is not working as advertised.
- The buttons assigned for volume aren't smooth enough and make a uncomfortable noise.

Verdict
A good looking, easy to carry, quality headphone, recommended for people who are looking for a good quality headphone within Rs. 1200-1600. I bought my piece at Rs. 1499. and when I write this review a week later, I see that the price came to Rs. 1199 as a part of Festival Sale. So, I think this is the best time to buy it.

Moreover, Welcome/Exit messages are just Awesome.

Awesome headphones @1399/- (lighting deal),"This headphone is good for the price but RockerZ 510 is far better than RockerZ 450.
The 510 is extra bass boosted while this headphone feels like any other normal headphone .
I've used both 510 and 450 so if you wanna buy one then I would suggest you the Boat Rockerz-510 .",19,5
My 15 Days Experience Worth To Read!!!,"I am writing this review after using these headphones for a few days!
First of all, this device is built with a very cheap quality plastic. The bass feels very low, it's not at all punchy according to the price point. The mids and highs are good but the sound coming out of it is not pleasant to the ears, if you've used any premium pair of headphones then you will definitely gonna feel it. Other than this, Bluetooth works excellently and additional aux input is also very convenient. Coming to comfort, you'll be fine if you're using it for 1-2 hours, but after that, you'll start feeling pain in your ears. The padding on the headband is good and quite comfortable.

Final verdict: These are good headphones for an average user, can be used for calling and gaming purposes (especially for PUBG 😀) but you might feel discomfort after using it continuously for more than 2 hours, Bluetooth works flawlessly, but if you're a serious music listener or bass lover then these are definitely not for you.

What's included in my box: Headphones, Micro USB Charging Cable, Auxillary Cable, User Manual and Warranty Card.

Edit: After 3 months of usage the headphones plastic broke and the cups got losen. The sound quality is still the same but the bluetooth, unlike before, disconnects automatically a lot. Ultimately these are not at all durable and you can't trust it.",14,5
Superb!,"I bought these headphones when my ears started to hate my old Samsung wired earphones. I wanted wireless headphone for casual listening and wired for my Zoom classes (and for playing Games). I searched on Amazon and found this. It's just awesome. I am using it from about a week ( both wired and wireless form ) and it sounds good. Its not audiophile quality headphones but gets the job done. Its super bassy and has scuffed instrument sounds. I got it at 90% charge and after a week it is still at 60% with 2-3 hrs everyday usage. Mic sounds clear from the other end but you can't use it in wired mode. Also , you can't use the buttons in wired mode. If you plan to game on wireless/Bluetooth mode , there is latency of about 0.8s minimum. Hope this helps !!",8,5
"Great Bass and sound, premium quality and look","One word ""Beast""
Just go for it. Everybody will love it. It has great sound quality, amazing design, premium look, very light in weight, loud and clear. Happy to have one of these!! Just that it gives some pain on ears if there's a use of more than 3 hours but it's ok because you can take a break for 5-10 mins and bring it on again🤟 Boat has done a great job in market. Last but not least.. Amazon is all time best. Cheers!!",25,4
Box Seals were tampered. Do not buy from amazon. 😡😡😡😡😡,"This headset comes with a really bass heavy audio preset which to me sounded really bad making vocals sound real bad.
I initially thought about returning the headset but after tinkering with the equalizer it sounded really great with balanced bass and good vocals.
Chose to go with the boat rockerz headset because it had dual mode support (Bluetooth and aux) which the other headsets at this price point of Rs 1,400 like infinity glide 510 lack, and trust me the extra AUX support will really help when the battery dies out.
Coming to its battery i have been using it for 2-3 hrs for straight 4 days after charging it only once and it still has like ~70% battery left.
Currently using ""APO equalizer"" with ""PC Equalizer Free"" with ""Soft"" preset.",26,4
Really Good bass at price of 1999,"Writing after 4 days usage and here's what i found after using 3 over the ear headphones and many earphones previously :
Sound quality is good though not extraordinary or better than competitors.
Looks and feel is premium, way premium but not as much comfortable as it should have been when you will use it for longer.
Bass is somewhat unsatisfactory if u are bass lover and myself used to with JBL headphones so i find it not as pleasing as JBL Headphones of same price point.
Charging : I haven't even charged it in this 4 days of medium usage and there's still above 50% battery left so its just wow awesome about this headphones....
Connectivity : full marks even for range of bluetooth connection as well as bluetooth version 5
Overall verdict from my experience : For bass lovers, JBL and Sony offers much better experience and for rest of all features like audio quality, high volume, product built quality n finishing, connectivity etc just go for it and order from amazon as i have pretty good experience from ordering audio products from amazon app...
Will try to update my review if i find something drawback or else. Thnks",15,4
"Plug into Nirvana - Good looking, Easy to carry, Quality headphone around Rs. 1.5 K","Pros: battery life, Value for money
Cons: Very uncomfortable for long duration, Weight of the headphone is very high compared to standard JBL, The material will fade away as Sweat and dirt accumulates, Needs equalizer to be set up as original sound is too harsh (but once equalizer is set sound quality is good enough)

If you are looking for comfort don't even consider buying it. If you're looking for good battery life and a maximum usage of 30-40 mins per day then you can go for it (you'll feel the weight after 10-15 mins so can't wear it for more than 30 mins) .",4,4
Aint Good as RockerZ-510,"My biggest gripe with this product is it's size. Even after using the extension feature, I am unable to fit it comfortably on my head. My brother also complained of the same issue. We both have normal sized heads.

Another problem is the inside of my ears start hurting when using this headphones. No other headphones I have had this issue, so I am unable to use this device for more than one hour whereas other headphones/earphones I can use comfortably for a few hours.

One more insignificant issue I have is the color of the aux cable which is black. It should match the color of the headset because now it looks weird and kinda cheap when the aux cable is black while the headset isn't.

Other than that it is a good product, feels well made, good sound, battery lasts for a long time etc...",4,4
Mediocre Headphones! 😑,"At 1999 they are decent.

Pros
1. Light weight because made of plastic
2. Battery super cool @ 70 hrs
3. I am happy at 40% volume, so they are super loud.
4. They have thumping base
5. Call quality is good for this price.
6 connect easily and the Bluetooth range is excellent. I have tried them keeping my iphone in another room and roaming around the home. No distortion or disconnection.
7. They fold so are easy to carry

Cons:
1. Plasticky so can break any time
2. Vocals are not clear and are dull. If they had crisp vocals, these would have been the best in the industry.
3. They would need time to open up. For my ears they feel stiff and tend to heat after 2-3 hrs of continuous usage. Ears pain after this much usage.
4. No case or pouch but was not expecting eaither at this price.

Over all a decent product in the price range and can keep it as a spare headphone in my bag if i forget my primary headphones (Marshall Monitor BT) knowing they will always have some charge ( 70 hrs battery at 60% volume)",3,4
Two things : Bass and Battery,"I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.😢",Helpful,4
It's going to blow your mind!!!," The only thing I like about this is fittings on the ears and built quality sound is average and cost is okay until 1399₹ what I dislike about this is other reviews said it has type c cable to charge but it's not true at all also I got this product damaged update 3/aug/2021 at10:20am I received this product again damaged as you can see in pictures and videos, if any amazon official watching this please secure the products which are being delivered because maybe in future products are tend to gift to someone and in our indian culture we don't send back the gift we just received no matter how bad it's in condition. Kindly watch through the matter.",Helpful,4
Will require setup for first time use,"It's a good build quality headphones from boat and looks good in design. Sound quality is average and bass amount is good too. If you have used any wired headphones like audio technica (Sonic) or Sennheiser(HD206), don't buy this one. You will not like the sound quality from this product. It is more comfortable than boat 400 and little better in sound quality. While using in Bluetooth mode there is 1sec delay in sound while Gaming(in Pubg) and it's effect the gameplay. This delay is not happening while watching videos or movies. I don't recommend if you are buying for gaming. It's not comfortable for long hour usage as it becomes painful after some hours. Aux cable is not included in the box.",Helpful,4
Loud and clear sound,"Surprisingly got it for 1599 ...decent Headphones
With decent sound

Pros:
Battery backup is good
Look and feel is cool
Good thumping Bass

Cons:
vocals and treble might have balanced
Not good for long time use as it feels irritated
Might have improved build quality from it predecessor 450
Only extra Bass will not suffice good audio experience, it should be balanced , Boat signature audio is poor i think they should work on it.

Overall average experience!!",Helpful,4
Good battery life but original inbuilt equalizer is bad.,"This product is not bad but not good either..... I bought it for 1400, I don't know quality of other headphones aroud this price point..... But it has some flaws... Such as...
1) Noice cancelation is good if don't mind outside noice...
2) Calling sucks...... It feels like ants are in my ear and they are having a party.....
3) cusions are soft..... But can't wear them more than an hr....
But at end of the day sound quality is good... Listening music feels great.....",83,3
Very tight! NOT a comfortable fit!,"You can get a decent sound quality in this product.
You might not have an upto the mark noise cancellation issues.
Over the head headset doesn't have maximum head adjustment line, it may go tight on ears if you got slightly big head.
You can use aux wire to use it without bluetooth being powered on.
Overall in this price range boat could have given much comfort and better noise cancellation in this product.

Try different one if you need bluetooth headset in this budget.",102,3
Decent headphones with some evident drawbacks," Guys product is good sound qulity is alsoo good but use this product as you are using a peace of a glass this is very delecate my both the sides got cracked within a month of buying and now its useless really dissappoited with the qaualty of plastic uesd it is very cheap mterial , was planing to take more aaccesories from this brand but now its a questio wheter shoul i buy or not",18,3
Not durable.,"This headphone is fragile and you need to handle this with utmost care while taking off and taking on for use as it could break easily. (2/5)
Sound is okay as per price. Bass is too much as it dominate so much that other mid and lows got suppressed. Don't expect too much quality in sound. I would say it has okay sound and satisfy the purpose of music and videos. (3/5)
Battery life : too early to comment on this as I got it delivered yesterday only. But I think battery life is good according to use till now. I have started with 60% battery and used it for 2 to 3 hours and still it is showing 60%. So up till now I would rate it as (4/5).

Thanks",12,3
It doesn't have type c charging slot it has micro usb,"Product is okay and price is justified.
After purchase from deal, price further dropped by 100Rs that's boat adjuting itself to the overall quality it's providing.

Pros :
Works as advertised
Battery life same as advertised
Equivalent to entry level headphones

Cons:
Small ear coushions - it can get painful if you tend to use it for few hours
Okay sound quality - they are not much powerful
Fragile material - as other reviews suggested material is pure plastic so extension may break on force.

Overall if you want to use it occasionally or in travel, it works. If you want quality and confort, get better headphone.",3,3
Good headphone at 1400rs price bracket,"[BIG UPDATE]
IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.
The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]

I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.
Review after 1 day of use and will update
Price I paid 1800
Pros:
1. Packaging is good for the first time
2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.
3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.
4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.
5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.
6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.
7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .
9. Battery life is just as advertised
8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k for sure.

Cons
1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.
2. It's not as loud as I want it to be
3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.
4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat
5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good",10,3
Decent Headphones,The body is plastic even the piece that is exposed upon extension. So its highly likely to break! Mine broke and yours might be soon as well. So I'll definitely not gonna recommend this. If you already have them then Good Luck!,3,3
Evaluation.....,"The mic of the headphones doesn’t seem to be good, a person on call is unable to hear your voice clearly even in a quiet environment. As for a noisy environment, the noise cancellation is pathetic! I fact apparently the background noise is more clear than yours. Good music quality and pretty comfortable though. In all it’s a good headset not a good headphone.",3,3
Disappointed by Boat,"Hi guys, as expected both 450 and 400 are alike but slight high at 230hz and thump for 450 and remaining are same as 400

If you wanna buy a new one of head set for bass lovers go for it if you are already boat customer of 400 no need to upgrade
I also have boat 600 but it lasted for only 1yr approx due to non sweat proof and cushion has damaged but head set speakers are fine

😍 for 450

Pros
1) bass
2) good clarity
3) comfort

but after a hour you feel discomfort but later it will be adjusting for feew weeks 450 rockerz, which i not found on boat 600( AS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE), but very much irritating on 400 rockerz

4) Battery lasted for more than 8 hrs as I used high volume
5 ) value for money
6) indication for max volume and connection, blue light for idle position, red even for charge and battery l
7) quiet strong no room for breakage I hope they had build stronger than 400
8) mention of battery in Bluetooth section how much percentage left
9) connectivity is good as my home is 3 bedroom it came through two walls and outerdoor more than 15mts untill I go to down floor (400 had disconnected in 10-12 MTS )
10) you can connect to two devices once only ( i have connected to iPad and mobile at once ) plays them alternative this is good feature

Con's

1) As it was not fully over ear
2 ) it won't allow you to turn your face as it occupy whole neck (you should expand to max length )
3 ) pads are cushion but the gap btwn both speakers are less so some discomfort (boat designers should realise that little bit of space is needed to design as they beat everyone )
4) that's it

These heavy than boat 400 in weight and thump little bit in scale of 15/15 for 450
14/15 for 400

I have used 400 and 600 earlier as I suggest go for it for bass and mid lovers and budget 1500rs

Buttons are given as it gave on 400

They are strudy enough , my previouss I got for almost 4 yrs boat 400 , and 600 last couple of years as am the first customer who bought thatt in 2015 as no one know boat at that time I have recommend for more than 50 people

Now I have changed my opinion they broke of after 4 months I hope they are not that worthy if they broke out like this in between

I have attached pictures so that you can handle it carefully already bought customers, or else better go for strong one rather that it's",One,3
Sound quality is good but its very very delicate,"I haven't posted an image of the product as there are already several of them.

The headphone is sturdy and was received in good condition. Haven't seen any kind of malfunction or damage till date, it has a good design and looks premium
but,
on the other hand, the quality of the sound is pathetic and feels as if a cheap duplicate of the original. This was unexpected as boAt has a good reputation.

The sound feels as if someone with a rough annoying voice is yelling in your ear and the feeling that you are wearing a headphone never goes away, you are always being reminded of it and it's not comfortable to use for longer durations.

A piece of advice: Just buy the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z, it might not be a headphone but still the sound quality is the best in its price range, and it's comfortable in-ears and you get the feeling of actually being in the place of the things you are listening to. I have been using it for a year now and I still love it.

Buying THIS was a mistake.

Hope this was helpful.",Helpful,3
"Fragile headphone, sound okay okay","Headphones sound quality is nice... I got it in 3 days. It came in a very good condition.
Pros

Headphones are really great for this sound quality

These are dual function so u can use them via Bluetooth as well as aux cable(they do provide aux cable)

Battery charging time is good.. It can be used for continous 2-3 days with 1hr charging time.

Noise cancellations is very good

Very handy. Can be folded.. Into a compact form and also to 180degree angle

Headphone can be adjusted accordingly.

Sound quality is similar if use it with Bluetooth or with aux cable(which is great)

Cons

Sometimes Create disturbances.. Even I'm in a different room ranging 6-7m

If used for a longer time..ear hurts very much(but if u adjust the earcup u can reduce the amount of pain)

Bass is not that great...though not very bad.

Overall nice purchase... Mine came with one USB cable, aux cable,warrenty card, and instruction manual. (Pictures are attached pls refer)

Edit. After 5months of normal usage these headphones sometimes stops working suddenly,the Bluetooth is not at all great and now they r broken.the extenders are very weak and cheap plastic quality materials. I'm in my warranty period but they don't serve for physical damage. Very bad. I'm not going to purchase boats product again. Cheap quality product. They lure the customers into buying with their fake material quality.,sound quality, but only after usage u get to no Abt the reality.
I'll not recommend these to anyone",1580,2
Okay product,"Kind of ok ...few things which I noticed
1. You can't return it in case you don't like it. They have 10 days replace policy with same product.
2. Product packing is good
3. Look wise it's good nd soft on ears
4. Not connecting to Sony smart tv w95d series.
5. On watsapp call sound is very low with background noise
6. Latency in sound in compared to wired one
7. No charger only charging cable in box.company should give a charger too
8. For music sound quality is ok in compared to price which v pay.",67,2
Boat makes the best value Products that only last briefly,"The first thing I noticed was how heavier and better built it was compared to my Infinity Glide 500. A really good looking pair of headphones, I must admit.

HOWEVER, the sound is.. bad at best. Even with a ton of fine tuning with a professional app the mods and highs are pretty much subdued compared to the heavy bass. Heavy but muddled. Instrument separation is all over the place and clarity is VERY POOR.

Hell, my 8 year old Sony XD150 (wired, over ear) headphones still sound better than these. And my 4 year old XB 450 I'd miles better still. ASTOUNDING. SHOCKING, how these sell so much.

Millions of marketing budget and good looks, I guess. This works better as a fashion accessory than a pair of wireless headphones. The only saving grace is the Aux cable. Somehow the sound is slightly better plugged in. From bad to just poor.

My suggestion: don't buy it. Don't fall for the made in India BS.. It's not. It looks a lot like a Blaupunkt model, with slight variations. There are tons of better Chinese pairs and even Indian ones. For even 899 you'll get a lot of far superior wired headphones and quite a few Bluetooth ones as well.",27,2
Technically all good but a fragile piece,"What I liked:
1. Very easy to connect to devices
2. Connects to two devices at a time so you can easily switch between your phone and laptop calls

What I didn't like:
1. Not too impressed overall
2. Find it too tight on my head so cannot use this headset for long time. Heads starts to pain after about 30mins of continuous wearing. But I know my head is little bigger in size so that might be the reason
3. I find the device interfering with my 2.4G wifi signal. As such I tend to lose some words being said when using it with my laptop calls
4. This is specific to me but the price reduced by almost half just a few days after my purchase 🙂",10,2
Not satisfactory,"From my side I listen to EDM songs most the surrounding sounds of this headphones is good but when it comes to bass the song and base will combine and the sound becomes messy so, from my side please go for boat rockers 400 for EDM and hard rock songs I use this headphones for 10 and it didn't make me happy and rest is upto you",4,2
Good one as we can upgrade to 450 from 400 but these are not strong enough broke of within 4months,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now...",3,2
BLOWN EXPECTATIONS! READ BEFORE BUYING.,"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.

1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.
2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.
3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.
5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.
4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?

Good quality headphones (edit:pls read the 2nd review after 5month usage),Never have I seen as fragile headphone as this one.

"No return, no sony smart tv connection, no noise cancellation, low sound on watsapp video call","Poor build quality.

Not soo good as expected 😟☹️," I Think you wouldn't even turn your heads to see this product after this. Such crap product this is.
This product has durability below 0. I brought this product on Sep 2019. It had very good sound quality and worked very well for around 3 months until i discovered a crack that had developed in the right ear side. I thought it was nothing. But in 1 week the crack had developed very much and it broke.

I thought this might be an error among the company and I claimed for a warranty. They gave me a new product, the same new headphone and I was so happy for them. But then came the devil in disguise. That one broke in a very short time not even lasted 2 months of time. I used it with the broken handle, very soon the mic stopped working and I claimed my warranty since it was active. The person who came to pick up my product didnt give a new one, instead he picked the old and just walked away. Also theres been no PROPER UPDATE from BOAT regarding this. So please please dont buy this product. It will save 1600 bucks, because this product isnt even worth a penny. I hope the authorities see this and please help me out.",332,1

Simply Awful,"Recently ordered the product so after using it for about 6 hours constantly, here is my review in pros and cons.

▪nice bass and sound quality.
▪premium matte finish.
▪ conectivity is pretty fast and good.
Cons
▪sound quality could have been better. i mean bass is good balance is good but sound quality is above average.
▪no aux cable.

I majorly bought it for jogging so i will update about battery backup and perfomance of this headphone afterwards.

MUST BUY," I m not a music enthusiast but i love the ease to use it.
Pros:
Easy to connect
Easy and light weight to carry
Good material quality
Good sound quality, okish noise cancellation
Type C charging port
Comfortable in ears

Cons:
Not so good touch controls
Sometimes little difficult to connect
Battery doesnt last even a day, hardly 1.5 to 2 hrs",19,4
Good product but support is worst,"It will get disconnect if the earbuds are attached or magnitised to each other then how are we supposed to get call vibration alert..showing some connection problems as well when it is moved from a statutory position.
1. Bad sound quality (people will say that audio could be subjective. But I am certain that for music, these sound bad. If you really don't care about that, well, check the next point).
2. The earbuds, as fancy and premium they look in the photos, are painful to put on in real life. Half an hour of usage and I found myself throwing them away. The buds were too large, and the rubber hook, too hard. Contrastingly, I own a Realme Buds Wireless (2 years old now), and I couldn't even feel I'm wearing it for long times.
3. The touch button is a gimmick. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes it doesn't.",11,4
Noise flair neckband review after 1 week usage,"I use a Bose AE Soundlink Headphones (for music & movies), AirPods (for voice calls and phone connect) and needed one that did a good job for meetings. This product really surprised me - for its features, for its functionality and for its quality. And within a week, I had to gift 2 of my colleagues, chose this almost spontaneously. So have bought 3 so far! So, why have I not rated them 5? The Sound quality can be a lot better - there's a very slight muffle that comes across. The touch controls are super sensitive - not designed for real use, so sensitive that even when I just adjust my collar or brush my cheeks, music starts playing, or call gets cut. The need to get that perfect, and I won't hesitate to rate them 5. Battery life is excellent, charging is nice and fast and its a great product, easily good to be priced higher!",11,4
Almost disappointing,"Reviewing after nearly a month of use.

Like -
Good balanced sound quality
Look good & premium
Perfect & steady fit in ears, doesn't loose
Enough playtime - nearly 30-35 hrs as claimed
Fast charging - less than hour
MIC quality is also good
Call vibration alert - best feature
Latency - good one
Soft touch control.

Dislike -
No volume control, have to depend on mobile volume control
Need to improve on noise cancellation
Touch control - feather touch, other object touch like shirt collar also works
The ear piece magnet quality needs improvement as it gets separated easily, thus turns on unnecessarily.

Overall a good product at the price. It should have been manufactured in India instead of China.

Thanks.

Review after 10 months of use....
Suddenly the headset start getting disconnect from mobile bluetooth, had to reconnect again n again. Complain online to Noise through their website. They home picked the faulty device n replaced with another one nearly after 15-20 days since it was within warranty. It doesn't look like a brand new headset but close to it.

Now after using the new one for about a month, sometimes the volume lowers down; then I have to unpaid n repair again & it works fine.

Apart from such bugs rest is ok.

Thanks.",7,4
"Not 🚫 for calling, Vary bad performance for calling","Call quality and connectivity is good. Bass and sound quality is also very good. Touch sensor also works fine.
PROBLEM ARISES HERE :- At too low volume the neckband sound is very high, which is hurting my ears. The lowest volume is also too loud. Did a lot of settings in my phone but no solution at all.
I tried it in SAMSUNG M21 & OPPO A54 (same problem of loud volume exist while connecting neckband to these two devices)
In REDMI NOTE 6 PRO - the volume is manageable, not too loud at low volume.
Edit(19/01/2022):- i found a way to decrease the loudness, i did equaliser setting in phone and make the equaliser at its lowest decibel and it worked, now no issues with this neckband. Also battery performance is upto the mark.

Make some noise,"3 start only for the build quality and 2 device pairing, the sound quality is good but not best the voice is crisp but not so loud base, the main drawback is passive touch system, this is ordinary touch not fingerprint recognised touch it means you will frustrate using this because it Play pause everytime mostly, I supposed to use this in gym but you cannot able to use it because the touch sensor is so sensitive means on every rap of bichaps it stop playing. Overall good product of they use fingerprint sensor and improve bass",4,4
Decent Product by Noise.,"Sound quality is good better then boat, battery life is amazing you can easily use it for 2-3 day in a single charge but i found some issue on sensor sometimes it work sometimes not and when you are in one call and there is another incoming call on you phone so you can't able to recive it and there is some sensor issue.",3,4
"Superb, love it",Comfort wise this is the best. No matter how long you keep it in your ears you will nvr notice its there. Battery backup is seriously good. But ppl could not hear clearly while riding bike with helmet. Touch has visible latency when it comes to changing the songs. Lack of volume controls is a clear drawback. Touch cannot differentiate between fingers and my shirt cloth or collar. so it messes up with the music play.,One,4
"Gdqlty but 2 fetre is misin vol key,call vibration doesn't work ..wen the earbuds are detached","Minimum sound of the headphone is also quite high , if you want to listen to some good and soft music , this is not the product.

Very Good product,"READ BEFORE PURCHASING ANY NECKBAND....

Noise flair are only best for call purposes..
If you want a nice bass and sounding neckband...
Go ahead and buy a TWS...
Don't worry they won't fall off your ear...
Or compromise with the call quality and buy the realme neckband....

Secondly...
Neckbands are supposed for call qualities and not for that proper drum bass sound...
If you want to listen songs while riding ...
Go for TWS...
BUT if you're a call guy..
These are best for you",5,3
Must read before buying,"the overall product is good with a big battery life and nice audio but the one thing that ruins this product for me is the touch controls. they sometimes automatically pause or play my videos and start my google assistant as they are very sensitive and very responsive. the other problem I faced was that sometimes when I disconnect the buds the device still doesnt power on... for that I have to connect them and disconnect again for the device to turn on.
the earphones do hurt after long hours of continuous wearing... I am talking 5-6+ hours.

The product overall is very good and it is a value for money product with some faults that sometimes happen.",6,3
The touch sensor is frustrating,"That touch response thing instead of the button is a grave mistake by the brand.

The touch response is delayed for like 1-2 seconds. So when a call comes instead of accepting the call, you would tap twice and disconnect.

The music and videos has it's own trouble. You would be enjoying your music and all of the sudden either it will stop or AI will be triggered. That touch thing works with clothes also.

I had the choice to go for one plus buds instead I chose this and regretting ever since.

JUST FOR CALLS ⚠️⚠️,"Product Quality:- No noise cancellation. if your using this on bike no use. your shirt collar also can operate the touch sensor.

Pickup person took my headphone by hand. there was no box or packing. company and logistic people themself damaged my product and claimed that I have done this. No use of call discussion.

overall a good product but with some major flaws,"It has no charging on off button hence, the only way to save charging is by putting together ear pieces which get highly loosely connected. Overall not a good product:
1. Can't be used without charging, which it never stores and hence can never be used.
2. No notice cancellation.

Very disappointed.",One,3
Not worth the trouble,"No words for design and sound. NC works good. Absence of physical buttons is a negative point. No volume controls. Touch sensors confusing sometimes.

Compare to that Less weight and flawless design. Call vibrator alert is good while we are riding.

will not recommend this to product to any one.,"Warning: My review is purely my opinion. I'll list out the issues I faced with this one so that you are well informed before purchasing this non-returnable product.

It's a really good earphone (on paper).
2 stars for making it feature loaded.
1. Dual pairing (this is better than quickswitch, as you stay connected to 2 devices at the same time)
2. Great battery life
3. Touch controls (first in this range)
4. Incoming call vibration

Sounds like a complete package?
Well, here's what I faced that made this device feel useless:
1. Bad sound quality (people will say that audio could be subjective. But I am certain that for music, these sound bad. If you really don't care about that, well, check the next point).
2. The earbuds, as fancy and premium they look in the photos, are painful to put on in real life. Half an hour of usage and I found myself throwing them away. The buds were too large, and the rubber hook, too hard. Contrastingly, I own a Realme Buds Wireless (2 years old now), and I couldn't even feel I'm wearing it for long times.
3. The touch button is a gimmick. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes it doesn't.

Overall, they got the spirit right. On paper they are offering pretty good features. But some cost cutting and lack of comfort research left me wanting for more, and hey, if the earphones SOUND BAD and HURT YOUR EAR, what good are the other fancy features worth?",Helpful,2
"This product is nothing like it says, it is worst product.","Don't just go for touch gimmick, awful product. Build is ok ok but not very good. Band quality feels like plastic on neck and becomes uncomfortable many a times. Sound is too loud at first bar also which is not good for ears and also if you want to listen in low volume. Talking about call vibration alert, it may irritate you since if you put the call on silence it will still keep vibrating at great pace. Battery is good.
Mic quality is worst, if you are even under a fan, the other party would hear the fan more than you.
I had replaced my first order thinking that there is some issue with mic, but the replacement was a used product with teared box and with micro usb cable, which the band doesn't support.
Please go for any other band, even the boat 335 may cost you cheaper and is better than flair neckband in every aspect.

Stopped Working in 6 months," Absolutely the worst neckbands i've used till date. The specifications given by the brand looks good but only the battery life sums up to my expectations.
The minimum volume on my device sounds like this on the neckband ( watch the video i've attached).
This neckband Triggers headache within 30 minutes of listening.
Sound is too loud and irritating bass is moderate noise cancellation is good. Battery life is good , one full charge goes one and a half day ( as per your usage).
But what's good if the neckband has sound problems?!
Go for the one plus bullets neckband range they provide absolute good features and has a good sound and battery range.",461,1

--> No volume control
--> Not sync with laptop volume control
--> 1 touch button is its total ISP, it's worthless
--> No music enjoy, it sounds feel quite sharp on ears all the time
--> Heavy Buds.
--> Not returnable, not refundable only replaceable.
--> Zero rating from me, if amazon allows me to do that.
--> All my user experiece went bad with this neckband and after 3 days its stop working.

Awful product!!,"The volume levels are very bad. The range between two volume levels is too much. And when connected to laptops, there's just no way you can listen to anything at lower volumes, its too loud at volume level 1. And then it just goes blasting your ears.
And the customer support is very poor. When a complaint is raised, there's just no communication apart from the automated replies that I got.

The service center was giving on spot replacement for realme, 8-9 days replacement for boat products but the replacement product will be delivered at our address.

Total Garbage!!,"Fantastic product. The build quality is superb to say the least. The wire is sufficiently long as well as strong (very thick - almost 3mm thick). This is the thickest wire I have seen on any headphone. The jack is durable and will withstand the test of time.
The voice clarity is excellent (A+++). I am not using it for gaming but for vocal recordings on a popular karoake app. The headphones also provide superb voice quality. Overall a very nice product which I will recommend highly to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a Great price.
Another feature which I like is the additional volume control in-built into the wire.

Faulty Make in 3 replacements,"This is a good headphone. I had purchased from the market three times and each time they broke the same way, while I was removing the headphone off my head the ear muff broke .. lol! I think my head swells with too much pride when I work ... rofl! anyways as I am a medical transcriptionist and a good headphone is a must and my old headphone is only for use as a crisis stopgap I went to Amazon website and purchased this one. Sound quality is good. You can have good Skype conversations also. The wire to attach to the CPU is long so no bending your head to the left/right so you can do your work ... All in all for the price a good purchase and also nice designs. I bought the Army grey colour one. It's cool. Thumbs up to this product! :)",2,1
Very bad volume control,"This is really cool man I just loved it....
I'm using it for my PS4 PRO and I wanted to go for vibration headphones but there's no 3.5mm jack to connect it to my dualshock 4....
There's option for USB too but I need to go the console for using it so connecting it to my dualshock 4 would be in handy rather than to go near my console.
The sponge/cushion/foam for the head is as soft as a feather and didn't expect that it would be of that premium quality...
My concern is that it would have been the best if it would be wireless coz it's hanging from the headphones like running nose..
Overall its a good product, I would recommend to all gamers to go for it...",134,5
Worst earphones. Not working within 15 days of purchase,"Bought it On 15th may 2018. N still working good. Long wire which is a benefit to me. Mic quality is really awesome.

Then in morning i put it in a bag of rice n it works as fine as before. Water made contact with the mic too but didn't damaged it. Works really good. Sound quality really good. It is slightly changed then before but not that much. Good bass. N perfect for gaming. Really comfortable for ears. Padding is really soft n durable. Happy for this purchase.",57,5
Gives us the perfect clarity,"I have owned overhead/inear ranging from 500-20k. At this price range, this is beast, it couldn't just get better. The bass is nice, there is clarity though I wish the base wasn't overpowering the voice certain number of times, thats fine as that can be adjusted in the equalizer.

The headphone is big but doesn't feel bulky while wearing as its lightweight, looks durable and sturdy. Cushions make it comfortable to use it for a long time.

Bang for the Buck!!,"I love this headset. I've been using it for over a year. The mainly purchased it for official calls and meetings. However, it works really well when I need to listen to music or watch movies. The microphone picks up audio really well. Mics broke off on my older headsets because they used to be separate. But, on this one, I've not had that issue because once the mic is folded, it's a part of the headset and is not protruding out.
This might be the right choice if you are an audiophile. If you are normal user who wishes to listen to music and use it for calls, it's the best at the price range.",16,5

IT'S JUST AWESOME 🤩🤩😍😍,"According to my personal taste i liked this a lot.
This is my 2nd headphone. Move to the 3rd para for direct reveiw. Writing the reveiw after using it for 2 months.

My first one was Boat bassheads 900, that heaphone is awesome their customer support is way too better but that was not comfortable for using nore than an hour.
Recently i bought Hyper X cloud 2, and thats out of bodget for max of us, but they hadnt compromised on anything about that, a complete satisfaction on that item. So basically i use

I have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.

If you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.

DEMERITS:
Personally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.
Sound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.

MERITS:
Now lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).
The best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion. And if you are gamer then forget about the demerits i mentioned, beacuse i dont think those demerits even natter for you.",5,5
SOUND.BASS.DURABILITY AT CHEAP PRICE,"Providing the review after 2 month using. Please find the review below

Pros:
1. In this price range this is a good head phone.
2. The padding is very good.
3. This is good for playing pubg. Right left year sound outcome is good.
4. In this headphone you will find a volume button which i found very helpfull as I am using the headphones in Ipad while paying pubg.
5. Now coming to the sound quality. Recording facility is really good. you will get a awesome recording sound with this headphone. You do not need to speak very loudly to get good sound.

Cons:
1. I am deducting one star because of the fitting issue. It is a little tight on head. Even when using it with max length I faced the issue. After playing for 1 hour need to take it off for sometime.",12,5
Dont think twice to go for it.,"I had previously owned this headset, the 3.5 jack cable snapped with rough use and eventually, the mic just gave up. I had used this roughly for 1.5 years so wasn't really disappointed. So with the latest purchase, I knew exactly what I was getting for the price. descent mic, long sturdy cable. I use this mainly for attending calls and video conferences. Its VFM, mic quality is pretty good, the only downsides I would say are - it's no big head approved, and their ear cushions are not comfortable for long hours of usage.",4,5
Good headset at this price range,"Nice Sound but not comfortable..
[Got them @15/SEP, writing this review after 1 month @16/OCT]

1. Sound and Mic [5/5] - The sound and mic quality is really so awesome! Since it sounds sooo damn great, NO PAIN inside the ears; and no need to scream for your voice to get delivered.

2. Build [5/5] - They are very stylish and look very cool! They are sturdy and hard enough to survive few shocks, padding is also soft. The wire and connector are also of awesome quality. Wire is very long.. so no problems in that!

3.Comfort [2/5] - They are really a bit bulky and stick very hard on the ears.
You are really going to feel pain on your ears, neck and head; if you are a medium to heavy user, but as time passes you will get more used to it. or you can just put a lot of books between them so that it can stretch as much as it can and not hurt you!

4. Compatibility [5/5]- No issues. Everything as stated.
For connecting with desktop, you need an audio splitter to split it into 2 Male Pins.
Which is quite obvious because single pin headphones don't connect to PC directly, or if u connect them to the sound one, then you'll not be able to use the mic, pretty easy to understand!

Summary of Review-
Loved the headphones, seeing the price, they are really value for money!
Deducted 1 star because of less comfortability.

Would I recommend it?
Yes, I would surely do! they are extremely value for money because of their mic, sound, style and braided cable.

Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth reading this!
The Review is 200% genuine and written after 1-month usage, it is not fake.",365,4
Worth it!,"I have been using this headphone for some time now.. i ise it daily for my office calls on teams and skype.
Pros :
Good design - looks pretty cool
Sound button on headset is an added advantage
Extended mic is awesome
Sound quality is good
Breaded cord is good quality

Cons :
After using it for half an hour, my ears start paining. This is mainly because of ear cup design is not good for ears, i think the cushion on eardrums looks soft but its not soft enough to comfort ears for more then half hour. Because of this i am giving it only 4 stars.",422,4
Awesome GAMING headphone under 1000.,"I play multiplayer games where sound cue could make or break your round/match. These headphones have really improved my sensitivity to such sounds and I've been able to perform slightly better in my games.

However, if you plan to watch movies /listen to music on these headphones and it's an important element for you to consider then I suggest looking elsewhere.

Can be used with PC and PS4,"The product is fine with respect of its price. 699 is what i got for and the lowest it goes during sale.

Pros
The sound quality is good
No distortion while using on full volume ( depends on the song if it has more bass then there will be distortion with full volume )
The sound signature is good, the mids and highs are impressive with the low end being high making this perfect for gamimg and music
This is perfect for gamers and music listeners

Cons
The headset is not so comfy on my ears ( although do note that my ears are big and if your ears are small you wont have any problem )

Heavy and Bold looks. But take ur time to get the details,"The sound clarity is good, you can literally listen to songs by keeping the volume upto 90%. For gaming you can probably keep it to 60-80% depending on your preference. Sound quality is sharp and while playing games like pubg you can hear the footsteps quite clearly. The mic does a decent job, its not the best but for the low price you cant ask for anything better. You can go for it. Its quite heavy too compared to other headphones we normally use.",Helpful,4
Good purchase in this price range,"Both sound and mic voice clear enough. I can hear long distance footsteps easily in Apex, PUBG, etc. But it's not comfortable for me. I need to take it out every 30 min or less. I found it has a very small space ear space (you guys can see egg space) that why it gets hurt if I wear it for a long time. And I don't know either that I'm the only one facing a comfortable issue.

descent headset for the price,"Writing this review after a year of usage. Headphone is good for gaming or i would say best headphone in this price range but when it comes to durability, it doesn't last more than 5 to 6 months. Sound quality degraded, volume level reduces after few months of uses, ear cups torns out as shown in the picture and lots of static noicse coming out from headphone jack. I have played lots of pubg mobile matches using this headphone, it performs well in the beginning, it gives exact location and footsteps of enemy but at the end, there exist a term called durability which this headphone doesn't really poses. If you're a hardcore gamer, this headphone isn't for you but if you can consider the durability, you can go for it. Hence, 3 stars.",Helpful,4
"Nice Sound, not very comfortable","no idea why 7k people have given such good reviews just to mislead people,maybe because this comes with a 3mm audio jack and fits most devices instead of the typical usb style which other gaming headsets come with. out of the box the product looked cheap quality.i kid you not compare it with redgear cosmic 7.1 that comes with in this range.i have rough used many times but it had a metal headband,braided wires with extra protection wrapped inside a plastic casing and the cushions were the most comfortable. after 3years of dropping it many times stretching the wires by mistake etc etc. it finally had an issue on one side with a small malfunction on the connecting wires. but I thought I'll buy another brand because it was a bit heavier on the head because of all the extra cushioning etc and also the mic was disturbance most of the time. so I saw this with so many good reviews and looked light weight and also the mic can be hidden.

but biggest mistake of my life.this is just crap infront of it. with quality (full of cheap plastic.i dunno if it will survive a drop)and audio too is not that great. I regret the purchase.",3,4
Good.. but could be awesome. Ears paining.,"Purchased it for office calls. Mic clarity is excellent and eliminates few (not all) background noises compared to normal bluetooth headphones. Audio quality is good. Only con is after 1 hrs my ear starts paining.

Received replacement headset within 2 day, again there was no seal and the headphones box was in poor shape but the headphones was good. So keeping it.",4,4

Honest review,"Sound is ok no great shakes but the mic is not compatible / adequate for the laptop. changed it once hoping it was a defective product but the replacement is equally bad.

Note: This appears to be the case only with the laptop (tested with 3 of them) . With the phone, the mic seems all right so there is some issue with mic gain / pickup I guess.

Delivery and service are excellent though.",19,3
Its worth it for the price,"Hi. I write this review about 1 month after buying the product. The plastic model, the wires are all good, sound is also good. The on/off along with volume control box is the only big problem. Although useless, the on/off switch stopped working 2 days after I bought it, which is no big deal, but the highest volume of the headphone is available only if I use the product while the switch is off(it's possible by first plugging it, then on then pushing it to off while plugged in) which is crap. It should be at highest volume without any of this. Otherwise, a solid product for it price. 👍😋",7,3
Sound quality is clear enough but it's not comfortable for me.,"Don't buy these headphones, I've used these for about a year and a half now, it's good for the price, but trust me, it's much better to save up and go for 2500-4000 headphones. Some of the problems I've faced are:

(i) Peeling of the red-colored fabric on the cushions which will expose the white cushion which turns to brown from dust very fast, the stylish game'ish feels will turn into a homeless man feel very fast (refer to attached pic)
(ii) Not comfortable if u have large ears, it will compress your ears and create pain, ive used it for a year so im used to it but would not recommend.
(iii) Requires an external splitter if u wana use the mic on the desktop
(iv) Audio quality is very poor but its playable (turn on loudness equalization in windows settings or you cant even hear footsteps) reached gold nova master in csgo and sound was not the thing holding me back
(v) Not suited for songs or movies, the audio is very washed out and bass is nonexistent",Helpful,3
Durability.,"Pros: Clarity and sound amplify ability at least by 1.5 times the normal is absolutely great

Cons: Since the volume adjust button is given on the left side of the cable, after 30 mins or more, it gives neck pain on the left side,

Note: If volume adjust button is some where else except on the cable, this is a great device",Helpful,3
4stars for this !!,"I like the product. I've been using it for my phone and it's pretty good. Especially, I love the mic on it. It sounds sharp and is great for calls and meetings! I've only had a good experience on my phone though because for PC it requires a splitter cable for audio and mic which I think is the only bad thing about this headset. Would recommend for mobile devices but for pc, I would say buy another one or get a splitter cable. Also, the cable is of poor quality quality, it can be easily cut/damaged.",11,3
Using it for office calls,"Great sound , comfortable , but 3,5 mm plug is SO bulky !! hence , when we play 3,4 finger claw , the Plug is giving huge discomfort !!! hence, after just 5 days use : lost stereo, random self unplugging while gaming , have to replugg all time ( facing all audio phone set up on screen to readjust while action gaming ) ....Impossible to enjoy anymore after less than 25 hours use !!! waste of Money ...should have a smart small 3,5 plug ...rest is super good ....",One,3
NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS,"Bought these for taking calls, but unfortunately there's nothing great in them except the voice clarity. Highly uncomfortable for big head people and doesn't sit well on earlobes.
I could have given one more star but even the sound quality is not upto the mark, listening to songs is a complete no no....I am not sure about the other reviews regarding the gameing since I am not one, but if you are taking this as an all rounder than definitely not a good choice.",Helpful,3
Mic not adequate for a laptop,"See the product in itself is fine and you might find it quite decent at first, but after using this for more than 2 months i am writing this review. I ordered this for gaming/discord purposes and for a month it worked fine, until one day one side of the headphone stopped working altogether! it did fall off by bed once but not from much height. Overall i would say its decent till its working but i am pretty sure it will not work more than 2-3 months.

-long usage for 1 hour or more really does start to pain in the ear.
-Microphone on/off button was not working since the start (mic worked fine thou).
-Build quality is good and sturdy although ill warn you they are really quite big, doesn't really looks good on head (pointed out by many many people).

If you really just want to flaunt the design of the headset its nice, (i have just hung it in the room now :p) or else i would strongly suggest all you guys who wants a gaming headphones, to save a bit more money and not go for cosmic byte in general.",2,3
Very good if the volume regulating box wasn't there,"I bought it for playing pubg in my mobile poco F1 but sound quality is superb but it's too low ...I even can't hear a foot step when he is approaching towards me....

Good but not good,"Pros:
Build quality

These headphones are very budget friendly for its specs, but that's because they have many problems.
The sound quality is definitely lacking. Low even when compared to my cheaper earphones.

Nothing great except mic...,"Well where should I start ok from good things

The product is good but it is expected to not work after long time , the sound produced is ok not good sometimes you can feel differences in both side

The delivery is too slow and in my case the headphone is not working after 7 months , customer service told to contact the company, the company is tooooo slow and you have to wait too long , now I asked for replacement and its 3rd day when they agreed too , they are telling to send the headphone to them or might they will come and take it and after 2 to 3 days they will get them , then they will check weather they are having problems or not than I think after 10 to 15 days u will get them , I wouldn't recommend you this headphone at all",4,2
Not a very good product. (do read this),"You can buy this headsets as use and throw one, because after a couple of months the sound stops comming or decreases from either side. So kinda weird but sound quality is absolutely awesome either for gaming or for music, i am a heavy gamer and the most basic thing which a gamer needs is clear audio with noice cancellation so these headsets are best for starting.

cosmic byte sound quality is crap.",Helpful,2
Way too uncomfortable,The mic stopped working in a month. No warranty or support. Now i'm stuck with this useless pair of flimsy headphones. This is sad. Please invest on some other quality headphones who offers you after sales support,Helpful,2
I wouldn't recommend this,Dont purchase this by seeing all the postitive reviews. Most of them seem to never haver used a proper earphone or headphone. My elearphones have better audio quality than these headphones and they only cost Rs100 more. The audio quality is so pathetic that you will never be able to pinpoint the exact location of gun fire or footsteps,228,1
Neither too good nor too bad,"I've used these headphones for a month now and that's more than enough time to tell if they're bad.... or bad! The build isn't very durable, the audio quality has decread drastically over the past few days, (sounds distorted/static). Microphone is below average. In-game the only thing my teammates hear is the dog barking in the ground-floor, and I was on the terrace. Tried turning off audio enhancements, but it didn't make a difference. I wasn't sent a defective product. They worked fine the first week or so.

Conclusion:
For the price it's understandable, but it could be better. If you respect your ears then don't buy this product.",46,1
***Worst Product***DO NOT BUY***,"Bought it because I had a specific need for volume control since my smart TV doesn't let me change the volume when a headphone is connected. The highest volume these headphones provided compares to the default volume on my boat earphones when I connected it to my TV.
Thankfully I can return it since it doesn't meet the purpose.
However the sound is clear and it's okay enough for gaming purpose.

Also, I didn't get the user manual with it which isn't necessary for a pair of headphones but is necessary to know about the use of the package. I feel like I was given a returned piece, which is really annoying.",31,1
Not for gaming,"The quality of this product is worst, during only 4 weeks of use, the jack pin broke inside the tab midway. Was difficult to take out broken part of jack pin. On reporting this damage to the manufacturer being due to poor quality and a manufacturing defect, they simply washed their hands by saying that it's a damage and is not covered under warranty. I fail to understand if a jack pin breaks midway into the tab, then why it can't be accepted by manufacturer as it's manufacturing defect of product.

Replacement,"It's a classic cheap crap. Purchased on 7th August and the microphone stopped picking up anything at all today, on 31st.

Update: They replaced the product and that Mic stopped working in another 4 months. So in less than 6 months, the model broke twice. Buy a ₹60 earphone from roadside hawkers, but not this.

Not good lul,"Fantastic product. The build quality is superb to say the least. The wire is sufficiently long as well as strong (very thick - almost 3mm thick). This is the thickest wire I have seen on any headphone. The jack is durable and will withstand the test of time.
The voice clarity is excellent (A+++). I am not using it for gaming but for vocal recordings on a popular karoake app. The headphones also provide superb voice quality. Overall a very nice product which I will recommend highly to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a Great price.
Another feature which I like is the additional volume control in-built into the wire.
Thank you",One,1
Disappointed with the highest volume,"This is a good headphone. I had purchased from the market three times and each time they broke the same way, while I was removing the headphone off my head the ear muff broke .. lol! I think my head swells with too much pride when I work ... rofl! anyways as I am a medical transcriptionist and a good headphone is a must and my old headphone is only for use as a crisis stopgap I went to Amazon website and purchased this one. Sound quality is good. You can have good Skype conversations also. The wire to attach to the CPU is long so no bending your head to the left/right so you can do your work ... All in all for the price a good purchase and also nice designs. I bought the Army grey colour one. It's cool. Thumbs up to this product! :)",One,1
VERY POOR QUALITY PRODUCTS,"This is really cool man I just loved it....
I'm using it for my PS4 PRO and I wanted to go for vibration headphones but there's no 3.5mm jack to connect it to my dualshock 4....
There's option for USB too but I need to go the console for using it so connecting it to my dualshock 4 would be in handy rather than to go near my console.
The sponge/cushion/foam for the head is as soft as a feather and didn't expect that it would be of that premium quality...
My concern is that it would have been the best if it would be wireless coz it's hanging from the headphones like running nose..
Overall its a good product, I would recommend to all gamers to go for it...",134,5

Then in morning i put it in a bag of rice n it works as fine as before. Water made contact with the mic too but didn't damaged it. Works really good. Sound quality really good. It is slightly changed then before but not that much. Good bass. N perfect for gaming. Really comfortable for ears. Padding is really soft n durable. Happy for this purchase.",57,5
Gives us the perfect clarity,"I have owned overhead/inear ranging from 500-20k. At this price range, this is beast, it couldn't just get better. The bass is nice, there is clarity though I wish the base wasn't overpowering the voice certain number of times, thats fine as that can be adjusted in the equalizer.

The headphone is big but doesn't feel bulky while wearing as its lightweight, looks durable and sturdy. Cushions make it comfortable to use it for a long time.

Feedback for the maker: If you plan to upgrade this model maybe try to use a higher quality wire.

Dont think twice to go for it.",83,5

Bang for the Buck!!,"I love this headset. I've been using it for over a year. The mainly purchased it for official calls and meetings. However, it works really well when I need to listen to music or watch movies. The microphone picks up audio really well. Mics broke off on my older headsets because they used to be separate. But, on this one, I've not had that issue because once the mic is folded, it's a part of the headset and is not protruding out.
This might be the right choice if you are an audiophile. If you are normal user who wishes to listen to music and use it for calls, it's the best at the price range.",16,5

IT'S JUST AWESOME 🤩🤩😍😍,"According to my personal taste i liked this a lot.
This is my 2nd headphone. Move to the 3rd para for direct reveiw. Writing the reveiw after using it for 2 months.

My first one was Boat bassheads 900, that heaphone is awesome their customer support is way too better but that was not comfortable for using nore than an hour.
Recently i bought Hyper X cloud 2, and thats out of bodget for max of us, but they hadnt compromised on anything about that, a complete satisfaction on that item. So basically i use

I have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.

If you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.

DEMERITS:
Personally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.
Sound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.

MERITS:
Now lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).
The best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion. And if you are gamer then forget about the demerits i mentioned, beacuse i dont think those demerits even natter for you.",5,5
SOUND.BASS.DURABILITY AT CHEAP PRICE,"Providing the review after 2 month using. Please find the review below

Pros:
1. In this price range this is a good head phone.
2. The padding is very good.
3. This is good for playing pubg. Right left year sound outcome is good.
4. In this headphone you will find a volume button which i found very helpfull as I am using the headphones in Ipad while paying pubg.
5. Now coming to the sound quality. Recording facility is really good. you will get a awesome recording sound with this headphone. You do not need to speak very loudly to get good sound.

Cons:
1. I am deducting one star because of the fitting issue. It is a little tight on head. Even when using it with max length I faced the issue. After playing for 1 hour need to take it off for sometime.",12,5
Dont think twice to go for it.,"I had previously owned this headset, the 3.5 jack cable snapped with rough use and eventually, the mic just gave up. I had used this roughly for 1.5 years so wasn't really disappointed. So with the latest purchase, I knew exactly what I was getting for the price. descent mic, long sturdy cable. I use this mainly for attending calls and video conferences. Its VFM, mic quality is pretty good, the only downsides I would say are - it's no big head approved, and their ear cushions are not comfortable for long hours of usage.",4,5
Good headset at this price range,"Nice Sound but not comfortable..
[Got them @15/SEP, writing this review after 1 month @16/OCT]

1. Sound and Mic [5/5] - The sound and mic quality is really so awesome! Since it sounds sooo damn great, NO PAIN inside the ears; and no need to scream for your voice to get delivered.

2. Build [5/5] - They are very stylish and look very cool! They are sturdy and hard enough to survive few shocks, padding is also soft. The wire and connector are also of awesome quality. Wire is very long.. so no problems in that!

3.Comfort [2/5] - They are really a bit bulky and stick very hard on the ears.
You are really going to feel pain on your ears, neck and head; if you are a medium to heavy user, but as time passes you will get more used to it. or you can just put a lot of books between them so that it can stretch as much as it can and not hurt you!

4. Compatibility [5/5]- No issues. Everything as stated.
For connecting with desktop, you need an audio splitter to split it into 2 Male Pins.
Which is quite obvious because single pin headphones don't connect to PC directly, or if u connect them to the sound one, then you'll not be able to use the mic, pretty easy to understand!

Summary of Review-
Loved the headphones, seeing the price, they are really value for money!
Deducted 1 star because of less comfortability.

Would I recommend it?
Yes, I would surely do! they are extremely value for money because of their mic, sound, style and braided cable.

Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth reading this!

Honest review,"Sound is ok no great shakes but the mic is not compatible / adequate for the laptop. changed it once hoping it was a defective product but the replacement is equally bad.

Note: This appears to be the case only with the laptop (tested with 3 of them) . With the phone, the mic seems all right so there is some issue with mic gain / pickup I guess.

Delivery and service are excellent though.",19,3
Its worth it for the price,"Hi. I write this review about 1 month after buying the product. The plastic model, the wires are all good, sound is also good. The on/off along with volume control box is the only big problem. Although useless, the on/off switch stopped working 2 days after I bought it, which is no big deal, but the highest volume of the headphone is available only if I use the product while the switch is off(it's possible by first plugging it, then on then pushing it to off while plugged in) which is crap. It should be at highest volume without any of this. Otherwise, a solid product for it price. 👍😋",7,3
Sound quality is clear enough but it's not comfortable for me.,"Don't buy these headphones, I've used these for about a year and a half now, it's good for the price, but trust me, it's much better to save up and go for 2500-4000 headphones. Some of the problems I've faced are:

(i) Peeling of the red-colored fabric on the cushions which will expose the white cushion which turns to brown from dust very fast, the stylish game'ish feels will turn into a homeless man feel very fast (refer to attached pic)
(ii) Not comfortable if u have large ears, it will compress your ears and create pain, ive used it for a year so im used to it but would not recommend.
(iii) Requires an external splitter if u wana use the mic on the desktop
(iv) Audio quality is very poor but its playable (turn on loudness equalization in windows settings or you cant even hear footsteps) reached gold nova master in csgo and sound was not the thing holding me back
(v) Not suited for songs or movies, the audio is very washed out and bass is nonexistent",Helpful,3
Durability.,"Pros: Clarity and sound amplify ability at least by 1.5 times the normal is absolutely great

4stars for this !!,"I like the product. I've been using it for my phone and it's pretty good. Especially, I love the mic on it. It sounds sharp and is great for calls and meetings! I've only had a good experience on my phone though because for PC it requires a splitter cable for audio and mic which I think is the only bad thing about this headset. Would recommend for mobile devices but for pc, I would say buy another one or get a splitter cable. Also, the cable is of poor quality quality, it can be easily cut/damaged.",11,3
Using it for office calls,"Great sound , comfortable , but 3,5 mm plug is SO bulky !! hence , when we play 3,4 finger claw , the Plug is giving huge discomfort !!! hence, after just 5 days use : lost stereo, random self unplugging while gaming , have to replugg all time ( facing all audio phone set up on screen to readjust while action gaming ) ....Impossible to enjoy anymore after less than 25 hours use !!! waste of Money ...should have a smart small 3,5 plug ...rest is super good ....",One,3
NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS,"Bought these for taking calls, but unfortunately there's nothing great in them except the voice clarity. Highly uncomfortable for big head people and doesn't sit well on earlobes.

Mic not adequate for a laptop,"See the product in itself is fine and you might find it quite decent at first, but after using this for more than 2 months i am writing this review. I ordered this for gaming/discord purposes and for a month it worked fine, until one day one side of the headphone stopped working altogether! it did fall off by bed once but not from much height. Overall i would say its decent till its working but i am pretty sure it will not work more than 2-3 months.

-long usage for 1 hour or more really does start to pain in the ear.
-Microphone on/off button was not working since the start (mic worked fine thou).
-Build quality is good and sturdy although ill warn you they are really quite big, doesn't really looks good on head (pointed out by many many people).

If you really just want to flaunt the design of the headset its nice, (i have just hung it in the room now :p) or else i would strongly suggest all you guys who wants a gaming headphones, to save a bit more money and not go for cosmic byte in general.",2,3

The sound quality is definitely lacking. Low even when compared to my cheaper earphones.

Nothing great except mic...,"Well where should I start ok from good things

The product is good but it is expected to not work after long time , the sound produced is ok not good sometimes you can feel differences in both side

The delivery is too slow and in my case the headphone is not working after 7 months , customer service told to contact the company, the company is tooooo slow and you have to wait too long , now I asked for replacement and its 3rd day when they agreed too , they are telling to send the headphone to them or might they will come and take it and after 2 to 3 days they will get them , then they will check weather they are having problems or not than I think after 10 to 15 days u will get them , I wouldn't recommend you this headphone at all",4,2
Not a very good product. (do read this),"You can buy this headsets as use and throw one, because after a couple of months the sound stops comming or decreases from either side. So kinda weird but sound quality is absolutely awesome either for gaming or for music, i am a heavy gamer and the most basic thing which a gamer needs is clear audio with noice cancellation so these headsets are best for starting.

Way too uncomfortable,The mic stopped working in a month. No warranty or support. Now i'm stuck with this useless pair of flimsy headphones. This is sad. Please invest on some other quality headphones who offers you after sales support,Helpful,2
I wouldn't recommend this,Dont purchase this by seeing all the postitive reviews. Most of them seem to never haver used a proper earphone or headphone. My elearphones have better audio quality than these headphones and they only cost Rs100 more. The audio quality is so pathetic that you will never be able to pinpoint the exact location of gun fire or footsteps,228,1
Neither too good nor too bad,"I've used these headphones for a month now and that's more than enough time to tell if they're bad.... or bad! The build isn't very durable, the audio quality has decread drastically over the past few days, (sounds distorted/static). Microphone is below average. In-game the only thing my teammates hear is the dog barking in the ground-floor, and I was on the terrace. Tried turning off audio enhancements, but it didn't make a difference. I wasn't sent a defective product. They worked fine the first week or so.

Conclusion:
For the price it's understandable, but it could be better. If you respect your ears then don't buy this product.",46,1
***Worst Product***DO NOT BUY***,"Bought it because I had a specific need for volume control since my smart TV doesn't let me change the volume when a headphone is connected. The highest volume these headphones provided compares to the default volume on my boat earphones when I connected it to my TV.
Thankfully I can return it since it doesn't meet the purpose.
However the sound is clear and it's okay enough for gaming purpose.

Also, I didn't get the user manual with it which isn't necessary for a pair of headphones but is necessary to know about the use of the package. I feel like I was given a returned piece, which is really annoying.",31,1
Not for gaming,"The quality of this product is worst, during only 4 weeks of use, the jack pin broke inside the tab midway. Was difficult to take out broken part of jack pin. On reporting this damage to the manufacturer being due to poor quality and a manufacturing defect, they simply washed their hands by saying that it's a damage and is not covered under warranty. I fail to understand if a jack pin breaks midway into the tab, then why it can't be accepted by manufacturer as it's manufacturing defect of product.

Update: They replaced the product and that Mic stopped working in another 4 months. So in less than 6 months, the model broke twice. Buy a ₹60 earphone from roadside hawkers, but not this.

Not good lul,"Fantastic product. The build quality is superb to say the least. The wire is sufficiently long as well as strong (very thick - almost 3mm thick). This is the thickest wire I have seen on any headphone. The jack is durable and will withstand the test of time.
The voice clarity is excellent (A+++). I am not using it for gaming but for vocal recordings on a popular karoake app. The headphones also provide superb voice quality. Overall a very nice product which I will recommend highly to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a Great price.
Another feature which I like is the additional volume control in-built into the wire.
Thank you",One,1
Disappointed with the highest volume,"This is a good headphone. I had purchased from the market three times and each time they broke the same way, while I was removing the headphone off my head the ear muff broke .. lol! I think my head swells with too much pride when I work ... rofl! anyways as I am a medical transcriptionist and a good headphone is a must and my old headphone is only for use as a crisis stopgap I went to Amazon website and purchased this one. Sound quality is good. You can have good Skype conversations also. The wire to attach to the CPU is long so no bending your head to the left/right so you can do your work ...

VERY POOR QUALITY PRODUCTS,"This is really cool man I just loved it....
I'm using it for my PS4 PRO and I wanted to go for vibration headphones but there's no 3.5mm jack to connect it to my dualshock 4....
There's option for USB too but I need to go the console for using it so connecting it to my dualshock 4 would be in handy rather than to go near my console.
The sponge/cushion/foam for the head is as soft as a feather and didn't expect that it would be of that premium quality...
My concern is that it would have been the best if it would be wireless coz it's hanging from the headphones like running nose..
Overall its a good product, I would recommend to all gamers to go for it...",134,5

Then in morning i put it in a bag of rice n it works as fine as before. Water made contact with the mic too but didn't damaged it. Works really good. Sound quality really good. It is slightly changed then before but not that much. Good bass. N perfect for gaming. Really comfortable for ears. Padding is really soft n durable. Happy for this purchase.",57,5
Gives us the perfect clarity,"I have owned overhead/inear ranging from 500-20k. At this price range, this is beast, it couldn't just get better. The bass is nice, there is clarity though I wish the base wasn't overpowering the voice certain number of times, thats fine as that can be adjusted in the equalizer.

The headphone is big but doesn't feel bulky while wearing as its lightweight, looks durable and sturdy. Cushions make it comfortable to use it for a long time.

Feedback for the maker: If you plan to upgrade this model maybe try to use a higher quality wire.

Dont think twice to go for it.",83,5

Bang for the Buck!!,"I love this headset. I've been using it for over a year. The mainly purchased it for official calls and meetings. However, it works really well when I need to listen to music or watch movies. The microphone picks up audio really well. Mics broke off on my older headsets because they used to be separate. But, on this one, I've not had that issue because once the mic is folded, it's a part of the headset and is not protruding out.
This might be the right choice if you are an audiophile. If you are normal user who wishes to listen to music and use it for calls, it's the best at the price range.",16,5

IT'S JUST AWESOME 🤩🤩😍😍,"According to my personal taste i liked this a lot.
This is my 2nd headphone. Move to the 3rd para for direct reveiw. Writing the reveiw after using it for 2 months.

My first one was Boat bassheads 900, that heaphone is awesome their customer support is way too better but that was not comfortable for using nore than an hour.
Recently i bought Hyper X cloud 2, and thats out of bodget for max of us, but they hadnt compromised on anything about that, a complete satisfaction on that item. So basically i use

I have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.

If you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.

DEMERITS:
Personally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.
Sound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.

MERITS:
Now lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).
The best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion. And if you are gamer then forget about the demerits i mentioned, beacuse i dont think those demerits even natter for you.",5,5
SOUND.BASS.DURABILITY AT CHEAP PRICE,"Providing the review after 2 month using. Please find the review below

Pros:
1. In this price range this is a good head phone.
2. The padding is very good.
3. This is good for playing pubg. Right left year sound outcome is good.
4. In this headphone you will find a volume button which i found very helpfull as I am using the headphones in Ipad while paying pubg.
5. Now coming to the sound quality. Recording facility is really good. you will get a awesome recording sound with this headphone. You do not need to speak very loudly to get good sound.

Cons:
1. I am deducting one star because of the fitting issue. It is a little tight on head. Even when using it with max length I faced the issue. After playing for 1 hour need to take it off for sometime.",12,5
Dont think twice to go for it.,"I had previously owned this headset, the 3.5 jack cable snapped with rough use and eventually, the mic just gave up. I had used this roughly for 1.5 years so wasn't really disappointed. So with the latest purchase, I knew exactly what I was getting for the price. descent mic, long sturdy cable. I use this mainly for attending calls and video conferences. Its VFM, mic quality is pretty good, the only downsides I would say are - it's no big head approved, and their ear cushions are not comfortable for long hours of usage.",4,5
Good headset at this price range,"Nice Sound but not comfortable..
[Got them @15/SEP, writing this review after 1 month @16/OCT]

1. Sound and Mic [5/5] - The sound and mic quality is really so awesome! Since it sounds sooo damn great, NO PAIN inside the ears; and no need to scream for your voice to get delivered.

2. Build [5/5] - They are very stylish and look very cool! They are sturdy and hard enough to survive few shocks, padding is also soft. The wire and connector are also of awesome quality. Wire is very long.. so no problems in that!

3.Comfort [2/5] - They are really a bit bulky and stick very hard on the ears.
You are really going to feel pain on your ears, neck and head; if you are a medium to heavy user, but as time passes you will get more used to it. or you can just put a lot of books between them so that it can stretch as much as it can and not hurt you!

4. Compatibility [5/5]- No issues. Everything as stated.
For connecting with desktop, you need an audio splitter to split it into 2 Male Pins.
Which is quite obvious because single pin headphones don't connect to PC directly, or if u connect them to the sound one, then you'll not be able to use the mic, pretty easy to understand!

Summary of Review-
Loved the headphones, seeing the price, they are really value for money!
Deducted 1 star because of less comfortability.

Would I recommend it?
Yes, I would surely do! they are extremely value for money because of their mic, sound, style and braided cable.

Extended mic is awesome
Sound quality is good
Breaded cord is good quality

Cons :
After using it for half an hour, my ears start paining. This is mainly because of ear cup design is not good for ears, i think the cushion on eardrums looks soft but its not soft enough to comfort ears for more then half hour. Because of this i am giving it only 4 stars.",422,4
Awesome GAMING headphone under 1000.,"I play multiplayer games where sound cue could make or break your round/match. These headphones have really improved my sensitivity to such sounds and I've been able to perform slightly better in my games.

Honest review,"Sound is ok no great shakes but the mic is not compatible / adequate for the laptop. changed it once hoping it was a defective product but the replacement is equally bad.

Note: This appears to be the case only with the laptop (tested with 3 of them) . With the phone, the mic seems all right so there is some issue with mic gain / pickup I guess.

Delivery and service are excellent though.",19,3
Its worth it for the price,"Hi. I write this review about 1 month after buying the product. The plastic model, the wires are all good, sound is also good. The on/off along with volume control box is the only big problem. Although useless, the on/off switch stopped working 2 days after I bought it, which is no big deal, but the highest volume of the headphone is available only if I use the product while the switch is off(it's possible by first plugging it, then on then pushing it to off while plugged in) which is crap. It should be at highest volume without any of this. Otherwise, a solid product for it price. 👍😋",7,3
Sound quality is clear enough but it's not comfortable for me.,"Don't buy these headphones, I've used these for about a year and a half now, it's good for the price, but trust me, it's much better to save up and go for 2500-4000 headphones. Some of the problems I've faced are:

(i) Peeling of the red-colored fabric on the cushions which will expose the white cushion which turns to brown from dust very fast, the stylish game'ish feels will turn into a homeless man feel very fast (refer to attached pic)
(ii) Not comfortable if u have large ears, it will compress your ears and create pain, ive used it for a year so im used to it but would not recommend.
(iii) Requires an external splitter if u wana use the mic on the desktop
(iv) Audio quality is very poor but its playable (turn on loudness equalization in windows settings or you cant even hear footsteps) reached gold nova master in csgo and sound was not the thing holding me back
(v) Not suited for songs or movies, the audio is very washed out and bass is nonexistent",Helpful,3
Durability.,"Pros: Clarity and sound amplify ability at least by 1.5 times the normal is absolutely great

4stars for this !!,"I like the product. I've been using it for my phone and it's pretty good. Especially, I love the mic on it. It sounds sharp and is great for calls and meetings! I've only had a good experience on my phone though because for PC it requires a splitter cable for audio and mic which I think is the only bad thing about this headset. Would recommend for mobile devices but for pc, I would say buy another one or get a splitter cable. Also, the cable is of poor quality quality, it can be easily cut/damaged.",11,3
Using it for office calls,"Great sound , comfortable , but 3,5 mm plug is SO bulky !! hence , when we play 3,4 finger claw , the Plug is giving huge discomfort !!! hence, after just 5 days use : lost stereo, random self unplugging while gaming , have to replugg all time ( facing all audio phone set up on screen to readjust while action gaming ) ....Impossible to enjoy anymore after less than 25 hours use !!! waste of Money ...should have a smart small 3,5 plug ...rest is super good ....",One,3
NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS,"Bought these for taking calls, but unfortunately there's nothing great in them except the voice clarity. Highly uncomfortable for big head people and doesn't sit well on earlobes.
I could have given one more star but even the sound quality is not upto the mark, listening to songs is a complete no no....I am not sure about the other reviews regarding the gameing since I am not one, but if you are taking this as an all rounder than definitely not a good choice.",Helpful,3
Mic not adequate for a laptop,"See the product in itself is fine and you might find it quite decent at first, but after using this for more than 2 months i am writing this review. I ordered this for gaming/discord purposes and for a month it worked fine, until one day one side of the headphone stopped working altogether! it did fall off by bed once but not from much height. Overall i would say its decent till its working but i am pretty sure it will not work more than 2-3 months.

-long usage for 1 hour or more really does start to pain in the ear.
-Microphone on/off button was not working since the start (mic worked fine thou).
-Build quality is good and sturdy although ill warn you they are really quite big, doesn't really looks good on head (pointed out by many many people).

If you really just want to flaunt the design of the headset its nice, (i have just hung it in the room now :p) or else i would strongly suggest all you guys who wants a gaming headphones, to save a bit more money and not go for cosmic byte in general.",2,3

These headphones are very budget friendly for its specs, but that's because they have many problems.
The sound quality is definitely lacking. Low even when compared to my cheaper earphones.

Nothing great except mic...,"Well where should I start ok from good things

The product is good but it is expected to not work after long time , the sound produced is ok not good sometimes you can feel differences in both side

The delivery is too slow and in my case the headphone is not working after 7 months , customer service told to contact the company, the company is tooooo slow and you have to wait too long , now I asked for replacement and its 3rd day when they agreed too , they are telling to send the headphone to them or might they will come and take it and after 2 to 3 days they will get them , then they will check weather they are having problems or not than I think after 10 to 15 days u will get them , I wouldn't recommend you this headphone at all",4,2
Not a very good product. (do read this),"You can buy this headsets as use and throw one, because after a couple of months the sound stops comming or decreases from either side. So kinda weird but sound quality is absolutely awesome either for gaming or for music, i am a heavy gamer and the most basic thing which a gamer needs is clear audio with noice cancellation so these headsets are best for starting.

cosmic byte sound quality is crap.",Helpful,2
Way too uncomfortable,The mic stopped working in a month. No warranty or support. Now i'm stuck with this useless pair of flimsy headphones. This is sad. Please invest on some other quality headphones who offers you after sales support,Helpful,2
I wouldn't recommend this,Dont purchase this by seeing all the postitive reviews. Most of them seem to never haver used a proper earphone or headphone. My elearphones have better audio quality than these headphones and they only cost Rs100 more. The audio quality is so pathetic that you will never be able to pinpoint the exact location of gun fire or footsteps,228,1
Neither too good nor too bad,"I've used these headphones for a month now and that's more than enough time to tell if they're bad.... or bad! The build isn't very durable, the audio quality has decread drastically over the past few days, (sounds distorted/static). Microphone is below average. In-game the only thing my teammates hear is the dog barking in the ground-floor, and I was on the terrace. Tried turning off audio enhancements, but it didn't make a difference. I wasn't sent a defective product. They worked fine the first week or so.

Conclusion:
For the price it's understandable, but it could be better. If you respect your ears then don't buy this product.",46,1
***Worst Product***DO NOT BUY***,"Bought it because I had a specific need for volume control since my smart TV doesn't let me change the volume when a headphone is connected. The highest volume these headphones provided compares to the default volume on my boat earphones when I connected it to my TV.
Thankfully I can return it since it doesn't meet the purpose.
However the sound is clear and it's okay enough for gaming purpose.

Also, I didn't get the user manual with it which isn't necessary for a pair of headphones but is necessary to know about the use of the package. I feel like I was given a returned piece, which is really annoying.",31,1
Not for gaming,"The quality of this product is worst, during only 4 weeks of use, the jack pin broke inside the tab midway. Was difficult to take out broken part of jack pin. On reporting this damage to the manufacturer being due to poor quality and a manufacturing defect, they simply washed their hands by saying that it's a damage and is not covered under warranty. I fail to understand if a jack pin breaks midway into the tab, then why it can't be accepted by manufacturer as it's manufacturing defect of product.

Replacement,"It's a classic cheap crap. Purchased on 7th August and the microphone stopped picking up anything at all today, on 31st.

Update: They replaced the product and that Mic stopped working in another 4 months. So in less than 6 months, the model broke twice. Buy a ₹60 earphone from roadside hawkers, but not this.

Not good lul,"Fantastic product. The build quality is superb to say the least. The wire is sufficiently long as well as strong (very thick - almost 3mm thick). This is the thickest wire I have seen on any headphone. The jack is durable and will withstand the test of time.
The voice clarity is excellent (A+++). I am not using it for gaming but for vocal recordings on a popular karoake app. The headphones also provide superb voice quality. Overall a very nice product which I will recommend highly to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones at a Great price.
Another feature which I like is the additional volume control in-built into the wire.
Thank you",One,1
Disappointed with the highest volume,"This is a good headphone. I had purchased from the market three times and each time they broke the same way, while I was removing the headphone off my head the ear muff broke .. lol! I think my head swells with too much pride when I work ... rofl! anyways as I am a medical transcriptionist and a good headphone is a must and my old headphone is only for use as a crisis stopgap I went to Amazon website and purchased this one. Sound quality is good. You can have good Skype conversations also. The wire to attach to the CPU is long so no bending your head to the left/right so you can do your work ... All in all for the price a good purchase and also nice designs. I bought the Army grey colour one. It's cool. Thumbs up to this product! :)",One,1
VERY POOR QUALITY PRODUCTS,"This is really cool man I just loved it....
I'm using it for my PS4 PRO and I wanted to go for vibration headphones but there's no 3.5mm jack to connect it to my dualshock 4....
There's option for USB too but I need to go the console for using it so connecting it to my dualshock 4 would be in handy rather than to go near my console.
The sponge/cushion/foam for the head is as soft as a feather and didn't expect that it would be of that premium quality...
My concern is that it would have been the best if it would be wireless coz it's hanging from the headphones like running nose..
Overall its a good product, I would recommend to all gamers to go for it...",134,5
Lasted exactly 3 weeks and 3 days (& the replacement broken in 3 months),"Bought it On 15th may 2018. N still working good. Long wire which is a benefit to me. Mic quality is really awesome.

Then in morning i put it in a bag of rice n it works as fine as before. Water made contact with the mic too but didn't damaged it. Works really good. Sound quality really good. It is slightly changed then before but not that much. Good bass. N perfect for gaming. Really comfortable for ears. Padding is really soft n durable. Happy for this purchase.",57,5
Gives us the perfect clarity,"I have owned overhead/inear ranging from 500-20k. At this price range, this is beast, it couldn't just get better. The bass is nice, there is clarity though I wish the base wasn't overpowering the voice certain number of times, thats fine as that can be adjusted in the equalizer.

The headphone is big but doesn't feel bulky while wearing as its lightweight, looks durable and sturdy. Cushions make it comfortable to use it for a long time.

Feedback for the maker: If you plan to upgrade this model maybe try to use a higher quality wire.

Dont think twice to go for it.",83,5

Bang for the Buck!!,"I love this headset. I've been using it for over a year. The mainly purchased it for official calls and meetings. However, it works really well when I need to listen to music or watch movies. The microphone picks up audio really well. Mics broke off on my older headsets because they used to be separate. But, on this one, I've not had that issue because once the mic is folded, it's a part of the headset and is not protruding out.
This might be the right choice if you are an audiophile. If you are normal user who wishes to listen to music and use it for calls, it's the best at the price range.",16,5

IT'S JUST AWESOME 🤩🤩😍😍,"According to my personal taste i liked this a lot.
This is my 2nd headphone. Move to the 3rd para for direct reveiw. Writing the reveiw after using it for 2 months.

My first one was Boat bassheads 900, that heaphone is awesome their customer support is way too better but that was not comfortable for using nore than an hour.
Recently i bought Hyper X cloud 2, and thats out of bodget for max of us, but they hadnt compromised on anything about that, a complete satisfaction on that item. So basically i use

I have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.

If you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.

DEMERITS:
Personally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.
Sound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.

MERITS:
Now lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).
The best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion. And if you are gamer then forget about the demerits i mentioned, beacuse i dont think those demerits even natter for you.",5,5
SOUND.BASS.DURABILITY AT CHEAP PRICE,"Providing the review after 2 month using. Please find the review below

Pros:
1. In this price range this is a good head phone.
2. The padding is very good.
3. This is good for playing pubg. Right left year sound outcome is good.
4. In this headphone you will find a volume button which i found very helpfull as I am using the headphones in Ipad while paying pubg.
5. Now coming to the sound quality. Recording facility is really good. you will get a awesome recording sound with this headphone. You do not need to speak very loudly to get good sound.

Cons:
1. I am deducting one star because of the fitting issue. It is a little tight on head. Even when using it with max length I faced the issue. After playing for 1 hour need to take it off for sometime.",12,5
Dont think twice to go for it.,"I had previously owned this headset, the 3.5 jack cable snapped with rough use and eventually, the mic just gave up. I had used this roughly for 1.5 years so wasn't really disappointed. So with the latest purchase, I knew exactly what I was getting for the price. descent mic, long sturdy cable. I use this mainly for attending calls and video conferences. Its VFM, mic quality is pretty good, the only downsides I would say are - it's no big head approved, and their ear cushions are not comfortable for long hours of usage.",4,5
Good headset at this price range,"Nice Sound but not comfortable..
[Got them @15/SEP, writing this review after 1 month @16/OCT]

1. Sound and Mic [5/5] - The sound and mic quality is really so awesome! Since it sounds sooo damn great, NO PAIN inside the ears; and no need to scream for your voice to get delivered.

2. Build [5/5] - They are very stylish and look very cool! They are sturdy and hard enough to survive few shocks, padding is also soft. The wire and connector are also of awesome quality. Wire is very long.. so no problems in that!

3.Comfort [2/5] - They are really a bit bulky and stick very hard on the ears.
You are really going to feel pain on your ears, neck and head; if you are a medium to heavy user, but as time passes you will get more used to it. or you can just put a lot of books between them so that it can stretch as much as it can and not hurt you!

4. Compatibility [5/5]- No issues. Everything as stated.
For connecting with desktop, you need an audio splitter to split it into 2 Male Pins.
Which is quite obvious because single pin headphones don't connect to PC directly, or if u connect them to the sound one, then you'll not be able to use the mic, pretty easy to understand!

Summary of Review-
Loved the headphones, seeing the price, they are really value for money!
Deducted 1 star because of less comfortability.

Would I recommend it?
Yes, I would surely do! they are extremely value for money because of their mic, sound, style and braided cable.

Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth reading this!

Pros :
Good design - looks pretty cool
Sound button on headset is an added advantage
Extended mic is awesome
Sound quality is good
Breaded cord is good quality

Cons :
After using it for half an hour, my ears start paining. This is mainly because of ear cup design is not good for ears, i think the cushion on eardrums looks soft but its not soft enough to comfort ears for more then half hour. Because of this i am giving it only 4 stars.",422,4
Awesome GAMING headphone under 1000.,"I play multiplayer games where sound cue could make or break your round/match. These headphones have really improved my sensitivity to such sounds and I've been able to perform slightly better in my games.

However, if you plan to watch movies /listen to music on these headphones and it's an important element for you to consider then I suggest looking elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, you can totally watch movies or listen to music on this but the quality might not be up to your liking. I am satisfied with it.",33,4
Can be used with PC and PS4,"The product is fine with respect of its price. 699 is what i got for and the lowest it goes during sale.

No distortion while using on full volume ( depends on the song if it has more bass then there will be distortion with full volume )
The sound signature is good, the mids and highs are impressive with the low end being high making this perfect for gamimg and music

Heavy and Bold looks. But take ur time to get the details,"The sound clarity is good, you can literally listen to songs by keeping the volume upto 90%. For gaming you can probably keep it to 60-80% depending on your preference. Sound quality is sharp and while playing games like pubg you can hear the footsteps quite clearly.

descent headset for the price,"Writing this review after a year of usage. Headphone is good for gaming or i would say best headphone in this price range but when it comes to durability, it doesn't last more than 5 to 6 months. Sound quality degraded, volume level reduces after few months of uses, ear cups torns out as shown in the picture and lots of static noicse coming out from headphone jack. I have played lots of pubg mobile matches using this headphone, it performs well in the beginning, it gives exact location and footsteps of enemy but at the end, there exist a term called durability which this headphone doesn't really poses. If you're a hardcore gamer, this headphone isn't for you but if you can consider the durability, you can go for it. Hence, 3 stars.",Helpful,4
"Nice Sound, not very comfortable","no idea why 7k people have given such good reviews just to mislead people,maybe because this comes with a 3mm audio jack and fits most devices instead of the typical usb style which other gaming headsets come with. out of the box the product looked cheap quality.i kid you not compare it with redgear cosmic 7.1 that comes with in this range.i have rough used many times but it had a metal headband,braided wires with extra protection wrapped inside a plastic casing and the cushions were the most comfortable. after 3years of dropping it many times stretching the wires by mistake etc etc. it finally had an issue on one side with a small malfunction on the connecting wires. but I thought I'll buy another brand because it was a bit heavier on the head because of all the extra cushioning etc and also the mic was disturbance most of the time. so I saw this with so many good reviews and looked light weight and also the mic can be hidden.

but biggest mistake of my life.this is just crap infront of it. with quality (full of cheap plastic.i dunno if it will survive a drop)and audio too is not that great. I regret the purchase.",3,4

Durability.,"Pros: Clarity and sound amplify ability at least by 1.5 times the normal is absolutely great

Cons: Since the volume adjust button is given on the left side of the cable, after 30 mins or more, it gives neck pain on the left side,

Note: If volume adjust button is some where else except on the cable, this is a great device",Helpful,3
4stars for this !!,"I like the product. I've been using it for my phone and it's pretty good. Especially, I love the mic on it. It sounds sharp and is great for calls and meetings! I've only had a good experience on my phone though because for PC it requires a splitter cable for audio and mic which I think is the only bad thing about this headset. Would recommend for mobile devices but for pc, I would say buy another one or get a splitter cable. Also, the cable is of poor quality quality, it can be easily cut/damaged.",11,3
Using it for office calls,"Great sound , comfortable , but 3,5 mm plug is SO bulky !! hence , when we play 3,4 finger claw , the Plug is giving huge discomfort !!! hence, after just 5 days use : lost stereo, random self unplugging while gaming , have to replugg all time ( facing all audio phone set up on screen to readjust while action gaming ) ....Impossible to enjoy anymore after less than 25 hours use !!! waste of Money ...should have a smart small 3,5 plug ...rest is super good ....",One,3
NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS,"Bought these for taking calls, but unfortunately there's nothing great in them except the voice clarity. Highly uncomfortable for big head people and doesn't sit well on earlobes.
I could have given one more star but even the sound quality is not upto the mark, listening to songs is a complete no no....I am not sure about the other reviews regarding the gameing since I am not one, but if you are taking this as an all rounder than definitely not a good choice.",Helpful,3
Mic not adequate for a laptop,"See the product in itself is fine and you might find it quite decent at first, but after using this for more than 2 months i am writing this review. I ordered this for gaming/discord purposes and for a month it worked fine, until one day one side of the headphone stopped working altogether! it did fall off by bed once but not from much height. Overall i would say its decent till its working but i am pretty sure it will not work more than 2-3 months.

-long usage for 1 hour or more really does start to pain in the ear.
-Microphone on/off button was not working since the start (mic worked fine thou).
-Build quality is good and sturdy although ill warn you they are really quite big, doesn't really looks good on head (pointed out by many many people).

If you really just want to flaunt the design of the headset its nice, (i have just hung it in the room now :p) or else i would strongly suggest all you guys who wants a gaming headphones, to save a bit more money and not go for cosmic byte in general.",2,3
Very good if the volume regulating box wasn't there,"I bought it for playing pubg in my mobile poco F1 but sound quality is superb but it's too low ...I even can't hear a foot step when he is approaching towards me....

"Save up for a better headphone, dont waste money","Im giving two starts because of plastic quality and generous use of cushion. The box came in unsealed condition in a bubble wrap all the corners of the box and lid of the box is bent and worn off. Looks like its been returned multiple times to seller already.

The speaker quality is good but mic a thumbs down. The other end cant hear me clearly sometimes they don't hear me at all. The one thing the mic is supposed to do .",Helpful,3
Good device with a diminutive glitch,"It's very uncomfortable for me to keep this headphone for more than 30 minutes. However it works fine and solve the purpose. The most disappointing part was that you cannot return the product even if you don't like it!

Good but not good,"Pros:
Build quality
Looks
Price
Cons:
Sound quality
Mic quality

These headphones are very budget friendly for its specs, but that's because they have many problems.
The sound quality is definitely lacking. Low even when compared to my cheaper earphones.
But the main problem I faced is the mic was not working, or having very high noise. Totally unusable.
I would recommend you to either increase your budget for a higher quality headphones, or buy a quality earphones for same range.",One,2
"3,5mm plug way too BULKY !! audio scratch , then No more audio after just 4 days use","There is nothing special about sound quality

Nothing great except mic...,"Well where should I start ok from good things

The product is good but it is expected to not work after long time , the sound produced is ok not good sometimes you can feel differences in both side

The delivery is too slow and in my case the headphone is not working after 7 months , customer service told to contact the company, the company is tooooo slow and you have to wait too long , now I asked for replacement and its 3rd day when they agreed too , they are telling to send the headphone to them or might they will come and take it and after 2 to 3 days they will get them , then they will check weather they are having problems or not than I think after 10 to 15 days u will get them , I wouldn't recommend you this headphone at all",4,2
Not a very good product. (do read this),"You can buy this headsets as use and throw one, because after a couple of months the sound stops comming or decreases from either side. So kinda weird but sound quality is absolutely awesome either for gaming or for music, i am a heavy gamer and the most basic thing which a gamer needs is clear audio with noice cancellation so these headsets are best for starting.

I will suggest you to skip this product and select some other one, I replaced this one with readgear cosmic 7.1.

cosmic byte sound quality is crap.",Helpful,2
Way too uncomfortable,The mic stopped working in a month. No warranty or support. Now i'm stuck with this useless pair of flimsy headphones. This is sad. Please invest on some other quality headphones who offers you after sales support,Helpful,2
I wouldn't recommend this,Dont purchase this by seeing all the postitive reviews. Most of them seem to never haver used a proper earphone or headphone. My elearphones have better audio quality than these headphones and they only cost Rs100 more. The audio quality is so pathetic that you will never be able to pinpoint the exact location of gun fire or footsteps,228,1
Neither too good nor too bad,"I've used these headphones for a month now and that's more than enough time to tell if they're bad.... or bad! The build isn't very durable, the audio quality has decread drastically over the past few days, (sounds distorted/static). Microphone is below average. In-game the only thing my teammates hear is the dog barking in the ground-floor, and I was on the terrace. Tried turning off audio enhancements, but it didn't make a difference. I wasn't sent a defective product. They worked fine the first week or so.

Conclusion:
For the price it's understandable, but it could be better. If you respect your ears then don't buy this product.",46,1
***Worst Product***DO NOT BUY***,"Bought it because I had a specific need for volume control since my smart TV doesn't let me change the volume when a headphone is connected. The highest volume these headphones provided compares to the default volume on my boat earphones when I connected it to my TV.
Thankfully I can return it since it doesn't meet the purpose.
However the sound is clear and it's okay enough for gaming purpose.

Also, I didn't get the user manual with it which isn't necessary for a pair of headphones but is necessary to know about the use of the package. I feel like I was given a returned piece, which is really annoying.",31,1
Not for gaming,"The quality of this product is worst, during only 4 weeks of use, the jack pin broke inside the tab midway. Was difficult to take out broken part of jack pin. On reporting this damage to the manufacturer being due to poor quality and a manufacturing defect, they simply washed their hands by saying that it's a damage and is not covered under warranty. I fail to understand if a jack pin breaks midway into the tab, then why it can't be accepted by manufacturer as it's manufacturing defect of product.

1 Star rating is given to add the review otherwise it should be -10.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO PURCHASE ANY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THIS BRAND.",22,1
Replacement,"It's a classic cheap crap. Purchased on 7th August and the microphone stopped picking up anything at all today, on 31st.

Update: They replaced the product and that Mic stopped working in another 4 months. So in less than 6 months, the model broke twice. Buy a ₹60 earphone from roadside hawkers, but not this.

[Just burning a couple of ₹500 notes have a lower carbon footprint - so there's definitely a better way to waste money.]",13,1
sound quality is crap and U must have splitter," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added.",9,1
Bad investment,"Boat xtend 1st review. Smart Watch working very smooth and comfortable n lite to wear

It's a fully loaded Watch except Inbuilt GPS you have most of the features available.

Call Notification, SMS Notification are working smooth.

Health monitoring services shows accurate value ..you just need to keep your wrist still for few secs still it's complete it analysis.

Music play is good

Alexa with limited commands display and respond back to your queries.

Display quality is good but not the best

It's a All-round budget Watch if you looking for complete Smart Watch try one with Google Wear OS might cost you around 10 to 25 k or Apple Watch.
Touch and Swiping Menu are smooth.

I'm happy with this Watch because I got all the features I want. Brought this on launch day risk I took worth it. As we don't have better option other than Noise ,Amazefit n firebolt. Now we have boat in lineup.",One,1

Lasted exactly 3 weeks and 3 days (& the replacement broken in 3 months),Have been using it for 1 day now and i have to say its much better than the other resonably priced smart watches in market now. Connectivity to the app is smooth without any issues. The watch faces can be customized. Health reading are correct by far. Battery backup after 1 day is use is 80 percentage. So i can expect the battery backup to last about 5 days.. The packeging was very bad. The box was crumpled but the product was scratchless. Loving it til now..,125,5
Best Budget watch,"Boat Xtend has amazing build quality and also has premium looks and feel, The watch is light in weight and fits on the wrist perfectly, the touch quality and display quality is upto the mark also this device tracks activities like footsteps, location, calories burn, stress level, heart rate and there are also ample of watch faces available in the app, i have used many other smart watches but i will prefer and also recommend this watch at a budget friendly price. boat has done it very well.",109,5
Best Budget Fully loaded Smart Watch,"I would say its a best watch under 3000.

- Alexa is working properly but little bit slower.
- Heart Rate is accurate and working properly.
- Oxymeter sometimes accurate.
- Sleep tracking is very accurate.
- Wrist wake up is working very smoothly
- Battery will last long for 2days if you use it extensively. Meaning with all settings on like heart rate, oxygen sensor etc.
- Stress tracking is working properly but cant commit on accuracy because didn't use it extensively.
- music control is working seamlessly but only thing is song name is not visible.
- Design and built quality wise full on rating. Looks like premium watch with very less bezzels.
- UI is awesome. Smooth touch and response. Full marks to it.
- Boat Wave mobile app connectivity is quite good. With good watch faces. You can use your pic as watch face.",104,5
SUPERB WATCH,"""Great looking piece for a smart wearable at this price point! And let’s take nothing away from it, the product delivers to expectations and is practical to the core. So to sum it up -

What’s great is-

2. Upto 7 days battery
3. It’s 5 ATM water resistance
4. Light weight and ergonomic design
5. Setup is a breeze
6. Activity tracking, heart rate (continuous monitoring) and sleep statistics with added health and wellness feature is a boon
7. Capacitive touch panel is slick

Good product,"Most functions (except Alexa) are working as expected.
Pros
1) larger screen and good UI
2) App is good

Cons:
1) Display transitions are not that smooth
2) Alexa interactions/commands fail almost 70-80% of time.
3) when trying to enable data sync to Goggle fit getting warning that boat app is not trusted by Google. That needs immediate fix
4) It calculates spo2 of couch as well. But compared the human readings of HR and Spo2 with other band (honor 5) and both are pretty much the same.
5) With Realtime monitoring ON, battery goes only for 2.5 days

MUST READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY," I ordered the day it launched.. Delivery was quick as I received the watch very next day..

I will divide my review in Like and Dislike about the watch..
Likes~
*Looks stylish big screen
*Great Features
*Good price
*Value for money

Dislikes~
*it lags when going from one feature to other
*No flashlight as written in description
*there comes 10-15 notifications of the same notifications from whatsApp and YouTube which gets irritating
*wake-up screen delays in waking about 1-2 seconds
*there is minute screen bleeding in watch
*Battery backup is not more than four days even after closing continuous HR monitor

Conclusion:- This watch needs serious firmware update on notifications problem and wake-up screen problem.. Overall good product in this price range

It's been three days only, Will update more after few months of use",43,5
Value for money,"I have been using this for more than a day now and so far I am impressed . I loved the color and model , it looks pretty good ! Pedometer , sleep , spo2 , stress monitors are mostly accurate . The auto brightness feature is great .There is no lag with notifications But the UI is lagging a bit . It takes 2-3 secs to turn on sometimes , Similarly Alexa too takes around 5 secs . After one day usage battery dropped from 100 to 70% so one full charge may last for 3-4 days . Overall i am satisfied so far .",38,5
Perfect smart watch at a budget friendly price,"I used this watch almost for a month and found few issues like it doesn't track your sleep accurately but that's doesn't matter for most of us.
Alexa built in feature doesn't work at all. It's says doesn't recognise everytime.

It is perfect for swimmers, gym lovers, running and other type of activities.
Looks good and mostly suits on all casual wears.
Battery life is good and goes for 3-4 days with full charge.
With normal usage battery goes for a week sometimes.

Best watch under 3000/-,Watch is very beautiful and it reaches the customer satisfaction.. in 3000 INR .. it provides you lots of function that you always needed .. very much completible with ios devices ..,1150,4
It's amazing,"Ordered this morning and delivered within 6 hours as promised. Packaging is good. So far experience is very good with the product though sometimes feels the touch to wake up is a bit slow. SpO2 and heart rate measurements looks ok to me; similar values I get from a pulse oximeter. Similar is stress. I am not stressed now and the watch shows Normal range.
App download and connection was smooth. Similar with Watch face download and change too. Yet to try sleep tracking.
I hope long-term performance too would be great.
Update after two days use:
So far no performance issues. BPM and SpO2 values in line with pulse oximeter readings. Looks like stress readings are also ok, though I don't know how it is measured. Similar with sleep monitoring.
7 Jan 2022. Ordered replacement. The step counter was unreliable, it was not counting all the steps. Some times, after walking 500 steps ( I counted it!), only about 250 steps were added to the total. Sometimes it is very accurate in counting.
Got replacement on same day. However, this one too has problem with counting of steps. I think in a day about a thousand steps may not be counted. Will verify again for next couple of days. If not satisfied, planning to return.
Other functions are ok.
Decided to return as the steps counter is not reliable.",944,4
Good product at reasonable price,"Pros:
- doesn't throw random numbers on HR, SPo2. If it doesn't detect wrist, shows error msg.
- light weight, high on functionality.
- display gets very bright, even for direct sunlight.
- small bezel, Big display
-very good watch faces, can also use pictures from gallery.
-waterproof

Cons-
Battery life is a small issue. I turned ON almost every functionality on max except Alexa , and battery went out in 3 days. But it's acceptable as it is not a smart band.
Numbers are increased upto 10%, so watch it.

For 2999/- it's a deal breaker. If u want battery life , go for bands, otherwise it is the best smartwatch below 3499/- category.
Smaller wrist people can also go for it.",26,4
Nice watch,"Been using it for a while now.
Tracking features are nearly accurate.
sleep tracking doesnt really works like the other features.
Loads of watch faces to choose from, liked that part.
Alexa works super good for me, catches even the slightest of voice.
Bluetooth connectivity worked great intially, but had to go to the app and connect, for it to work later in the month.
Built quality is amazing, looks pretty aesthetic and costly from outside, good if u wanna flex.
Message and call notifications work absolutely fine, except from the times when u turn them off, and need to start over again with providing permissions.
The pixels and display is amazing, no doubt.
Find my phone is a really great feature if you're somebody who usually happens to loose their phone in ur room.
Conclusion: Worth the price.",17,4
Notification feature sucks," Good smartwatch ,but a con is touch response is average and batter backup will reduce fastly ,if brightness is high and heart beat checking is on automatic mode in their application.so adjust it for vettery battery health .in full charge can use atmost 10 days max but not bad.alexa feature is slower but useful for some people and outdoor light also its brightness is above average.i got it for 2299 at great indian festival.so check offers and buy it.build quality is above average",13,4

Good but it can be better in this price segment.,"Good smartwatch! Will not say worth buying, but yes if you are looking for a smartwatch at a reasonable price then this is the one. However, you need to charge it for 2hrs mandatorily for the battery to work smoothly.

Notifications pop up multiple times and you will have to delete 1 notification for 4-5 times.

Kms tracking is not that great. Where google fit shows 4.81 kms, this watch will show 3.48kms.

1. Calories and distance not accurate particularly for Treadmill walk. It measures only by hand movement. If u are holding the handle bar and walk, watch doesn't recognise.

2. My treadmill data and watch data readings are very much apart.

3. I have a feeling that some of the readings are not true measurements but some software generated figures.

3. Call and Msg alert is erratic. Even though I do the setting , alerts accuracy is not 100%.

4. Watch wakes up when you move your hand on bed during sleep. Room suddenly lights up...

3. Battery performance is low about 2.5 days on Realtime Heart rate measurement mode. In Auto mode its about 4.5 to 5 days.
4. Screen responce is not upto the mark boat has to work on firmware and screen quality also resolution is not that much good.
5. Strap is very fine and flexible.
6. User interface is lagy may be an update will fix the bugs if there is any.
7. Overall good product to wear not to measure.
It will give u better look with low accuracy and low screen responce and resolution.",2,4
"Very good budget smartwatch , best in category","Hello, I'm an youtuber and purchased it for unboxing and daily usage, the watch is good but alexa didn't worked for the first time i connected and i felt like i should return it, but the watch is really attractive so changed my thought and tried it again, after i logged out and again signed in, after a while it's working fine. Well, Battery life is ok, didn't tried the sleep tracking yet, i thought to purchase mi band 6 but being owned a mi band 4 already made me purchase this one, purchased the sandy cream color which looks absolutely gorgeous than other colors.

Not accurate,"Here is an update after using it for nearly 2 months now.
The 14 Sports Mode given in this watch is just for the sake of having one. This doesn't even detect when one is Cycling. Only Running & Walking is getting detected and nothing else. There is no option for us to activate these Sports activity manually too.
As mentioned below, the Calorie calculator, KMS done etc., are not that accurate,
Battery life is very average as it hardly lasts for 2 days per full charge.
Sleep monitor also doesn't give a perfect sleep analysis as was described.
Above Feedback submitted to Boat team also via email, but yet to have their response.

Used it for about 10 days now ...
Step counter is more or less good.
Calorie calculator and KMS done is not accurate and has much variations compared to an Apple device.
BPM and SPO2 are just for fun I guess as these readings are not even in the range when compared to the readings of an actual BP reader and Oxy meter.
Message notifications, Music 🎵 controls are good.
Battery lasts for about 3 days on 24/7 use.
Has a variety of Faces and Alexa is a plus and kids enjoy these.
Touch screen response to be improvised a lot.
Temper glass isn’t recommended as this will further affect the touch response.
Wake Gesture sometimes responds very slow.",3,3
"Boat needs to upgrade firmware, software and screen responce","Pros: Good battery life and good looks (when screen not on)

Cons:
1. The display is not at all colorful. It is so dull that it actually makes you dislike the watch. C'mon that's the least expectation from a 4k watch. Display is really really dull and bad.

2. Doesn't connect to Google Fit. Well, it does in theory but the steps taken in watch won't ever be updated in your Google fit account. So if you've taken insurance and get discounts with steps taken (my agenda), it doesn't fullfill that agenda.

3. Steps count are inaccurate and doesn't match at times. The app keeps logging out and when you log back in, it mismatches the steps

4. I wore it at night to check my sleep, and I couldn't find any record in the app next morning. In fact, it is still showing only one day sleep recorded on July 8th for 3 hours. Guess I'm a sleepless zombie now..

Verdict: Don't go for this clock. Many wonderful options available at this budget.",5,3
Good one,"A good showpiece at 2.5k I'd say. Maybe it'll work for you but read this...

1. All watches (I saw every brand's review before purchasing this) in 2k - 3.5k have similar UI for watch and app.

2. This watch lags a lot!

3. Lags, even more, when you see extra characters in messages.

4. Not accurate at all, for accuracy, I'd give 30 out of 100. Counted steps even when I was sleeping, guess how many? 500 - 600 steps... Yes...

5. Organized copy of Chinese watches.

6. The lag issue was resolved in the app's FAQ😊 developers (Should I call them developers?) put the answer there, and it says that the watch is ""designed that way"" Amazing answer!

7. Few of my friends sent me some emojis on WhatsApp, this watch surprised me 😍 I saw everything in Mandarin Chinese🙂🙂

8. Changes the readings even in a difference of a minute.

9. My friend came to my house and I was showing its features, ye sath nahi degi rehenedo...
Alexa wasn't working,
the stress monitor was accurately saying ""Wear the watch tightly,""
for heart rate, the watch was disconnected.

10. Alexa does basic tasks but don't expect much, this watch can't show many charac... And you will have to read lik... 😐

This is a premium experience at an affordable rate, not every watch can do this, guys. Loved it.

I know I wasn't paying much for my fitness here, but at least I'm paying an amount! Why don't they understand it?

Now after wasting time and money on this, I ordered Amazfit Bip U Pro, which is... Of Xiaomi... What do I do I don't have so much money to go for high-end.

I'm sorry if I ruined your expectations, but this is reality and you won't get satisfaction after buying it. After some time you'll find other options or an upgrade... Because... This watch is designed that way😊😊 Right developers?",4,3
Caller name is not appearing during call," REALLY DISOPPOINTED!!

I ordered this watch after I saw the reviews and all and that was pretty good.
But in my experience this was my BAD DECISION to go with Boat watch.
Its been just 2 weeks I'm using this watch and the AWAKE GESTURE has stopped working. There are no pick up service available from Boat. I have to go to the service centre to register my complaint. THIS IS TOO MUCH.

DEAR BOAT, Please resolve my query asap.",6,3
Watch is okay but could have been much better,"The product is still in learning phase... There are many bugs, since it is connected to you phone via Bluetooth, the phone misbehaves sometimes...
It does repetitive actions and hangs.... The only solution being restarting the phone....
I have ordered 2 products and 1 was having continuous screentime ON...
Response time is also slow...
Overall this product needs more work, but looks absolutely beautiful...
Hope to see you soon with more fixes...",3,3
This watch is only for for sure & look nice,"Overall product is good but one major disadvantage is Connectivity issue.Blutooth connection is not so strong.If you want SMS ,Mails and phone contacts updates on Watch you have to open their app in background continuously ones you clear your phone ram memory immediately watch got disconnection after that you will not get alerts on your watch not for Anything.If you want alerts again then you have to open the app.

01 Blutooth connection lots is the biggest disadvantage
02 You can not get whats app notification alert on watch.
03 Battery Life is only 2 days maximum with full load like Heart rate monitoring, Stress monitoring,",Helpful,3
GENUINE XTEND NOT UPTO THE MARK ‼️,"All though I don't like the product it does a some pros

The watch has alexa so you can control your smart devices but only if you are near your phone.
Looks good, display is good... Good for normal use

Cons:
App based GPS tracking doesn't work properly, doesn't give proper mileage covered nor gives proper cal burnt.
And most worst is the Google fit sink. The app keeps on added the total every time it start syncing for eg. If you have burnt 100 cal ( from 9am to 10am) and ( between 10 to 11 no activities) thn during 11 am to 12 pm if you burn another 100 cal the synced Google fir cal burnt will be 300 because the app sent the 100 call for 10am thn it goes and sync again with total cal burnt at 12pm again which 200cal.... Such a huge bug...",65,2
It’s just like another Rs. 999 product ...,"Looks good, shows time, not very light, tracks steps but UI is not up to the mark. Good brightness and allows setting user photo wallpaper. If you can't afford the Apple Watch but want something on your wrist that looks like one, get it. If you want the experience of a smartwatch, this is nowhere close.",32,2
HONEST REVIEW POST USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS,The watch for girls is way too clumsy with cheap touch and feel and cheap plastics. The display itself is ok but the 2 second display is a no go. Worst thing is that the unit is offered with many different Sport to measure but it can only document time not meter or waypoints. Specially as it is offered for swimming were you want to know you time and distance to measure your performance. This is just a posh fake - a watch not more. Useless for sports and performance even the steps are counted wrongly. Better to invest in a Garmin or Apple Watch. Will send it back immediately. Amazon should not promote such rubbish.,18,2
"Don't trust Youtubers blindly! They only showed good side which isn't that good, bad points prevail.","It is just impossible to rotate wrist and look at display as the display turns off and on at it's own wish.

While operating the watch, the display can turn off at it's own with as it thinks you may have rested ur wrist.

I didn't trust the BPM and sleep reading this is showing.

The flash light is dim and it's menu is very deep.

Alexa integration is just to overcharge customer.

I also bought a cheap smartwatch worth 600rs along with this and that is better although it lacks rich touch screen navigation.",6,2
Awake Gesture stopped working,"What I liked :
Beautiful design
Light weight
Steps and bp measurements were good

What I don’t like :
Alexa won’t speak but just take long time to “ think” and print result ok screen ..
Even if you ask “ Alexa what is the time now” it will take a few seconds and prints “ thinking” on the screen and then prints the actual response on screen ..:
- Experienced lag between swipes",2,2
Product is still in learning phase,"It is a new product and it has so many bugs. I got this product on 9th July.

Ok for price not the best,"Very ordinary watch. Packing looks like a cheap product. QR code couldn't be scanned, have to shift to manual app sync.

Was very happy when it came to us and one fine day it just started glitching..the screen has a cut on top where in u cannot see the time..touch screen has stopped working and today is just the 26th of Oct.

Problem with display,"Wrost Watch ever !

Heart rate monitor is inaccurate
And the most irritating thing is when ever we try to calculate spo2 an HR it's showing the improper calculations and sometimes it shows and then again it resets everything . And
When ever the watch screen goes off or to sleep , then again we have to calculate the spo2 he and blood levels - which is a worst and ridiculous things .

Has good looks with usual features of a smart watch, but the calling feature is really nice with fine voice quality and connectivity. Probably, adding the thermometer feature should be good and helpful. Inbuilt watch faces are not so very nice and they have to add more of them. I feel the price can be reduced a bit more.

WhatsApp call alert not working for me.

Best bluetooth calling smart watch,"It's been just a day since I have received this product and frankly speaking, I am in love with this product.

1) Its calling feature stands out considering the range in which this product is (it usually comes in watches more than 10,000). But I don't know how to sync my contacts with the watch (if it will be done its usability will increase).

2) Microphone Quality is decent enough its speaker should be more louder.

3)Camera button in the watch only works with camera available in its application only (which is not we want), everytime opening its app (apps camera quality is not as same as your phones camera quality)

4)Last but not the least, I have faced problem in its Bluetooth connectivity (not a very smooth experience). As it have older versions i.e. Bluetooth 3.0, it doesn't have greater range of connectivity, disconnects easily. After disconnection its doesn't pair itself we have to do it manually (it takes like 4-5 tries not connect again)

CONCLUSION: Many things can be fixed with software updates but the hardware parts (Bluetooth and speaker) cannot be enhanced later on. Company must have though about it while making this product. Although its a great great product but these problems pulls it back somewhere and can't be fixed further anymore",54,5
Good watch,"I bought a crossbeats for myself and a fireboltt ninja for my wife. I liked the display quality of ninja more than crossbeats. Other than that, it's pretty cool. A normal one. One drawback i experienced is when I am in a call in my earbuds and when another call comes waiting, my current call automatically goes to smart watch's speaker. M not sure if everyone has the same experience. Rest all ok",52,5
Splendid Product,"A value for money product, I bought this for myself and have being using since a month now..
Pros.
Good battery life, have charged only thrice in last 25 days of usage.
Premium quality of case and belt.
Lightweight,
Ease of use,
Voice calling option is the gem of the feature, have to adjust a little bit in Phoenix setting before seamless usage of the feature, was sceptical before buying,because of negative reviews on calling features, but after some usage now I am acustomed by the calling feature. Voice reception and speaker volume are sufficient even during riding a bike.
All sensors like step count, spo2, heart rate and blood pressure are working fine
Custom watch face is a lovely feature too
Cons.
Bit thick in dimension and pops up a bit.
Auto screen waking feature is a bit lagging, doesn't always work,
Takes more time for recording blood pressure and spo2

Overall at the given price of 4500 I could not be asking for more. A go ahead for 1st time buyers for sure.",10,4
Nice product,"Overall it's good BUT there are three things I would like to be improved.

1) The sleep tracker is not much accurate. The watch neglects 1 or 2 hours which is lot.

2) There are very few GOOD watch faces. I don't have much options.

3) The weather function is absolutely useless. It does not change even when connected with the app. It will show only 1 interface all the time.

Bluetooth range is average but it's OK.

Otherwise the best functions are-
Calling feature
Music control
Step tracking
Find Phone Feature",5,4
Good one can hav more features,"Good looks with a leather look strap and grey metal body in matte finish.
Battery lasted 6 days after 1st full charge.
Dial clarity under bright sunlight depends on the dial type. The orange one ( as shown in the picture) was barely visible so I changed to white digits which is visible under bright sun light.
Interface with phone is good. Connection and synchronisation is fast.
Notification feature helps to read messages without having to pull out the phone from the pocket.
Connection with BT3.0 needs to be established via Bluetooth to assess call feature whereas the phone remains always connected to the CB-ORBIT for other features.
I had a few queries about the phone and those were promptly addressed by the Crossbeats support team via email and WhatsApp",2,4
Good watch by an Indian Company.,"The watch is better than I expected and has most of the features I was looking for Watch,Heartbeat, SPO2 , Steps,Sleep and blood pressure (this was a surprise for me) The features are all very good and are working fine , I felt the battery does not last as claimed by the manufacturer on the literature.

Great Watch but lags minorly in bluetooth conectivity (read full review for a better understanding),"There is no GPS tracking, I am aware that the watch doesn't have GPS but at least we should be able to track using CB activ app but that is not available so If you are a walker, runner or cyclist, you can't track how many km you have crossed using this watch and its app.
Other than that, everything is perfect.
Call quality is also great. Sometimes the Bluetooth disconnects.",Helpful,4
Good,"Watch look is good, however, the bluetooth for calling gets disconnected soon after the watch display went off. So its not justified for the calling functionality itself. We have to connect every time when we get call on the phone.

Not recommended for IOS. Returned back the watch",Helpful,4
"Value for money,","Overall the watch performance is good. But problem with the accuracy of heart beat rating and steps count.

I am attaching the Mobile app screen shot as well where it clearly indicates the synchronization issues for accuracy.",Helpful,4
Good,"If somebody looking for a stylish smart watch with an accurate notification and call system..you can go for this one ….now the cons, once we use siri to connect a call ,watch speaker automatically changed into phone earpiece… and also contacts sync is not in it..we can save contacts….then only 8 sport mode in this price is very much upsetting…if they can update it would be better..and the major critical issue is the sensor not working in everybody’s upper wrist..works in random hands…and the humour part is if it didn’t work in your upper hand also ,you have to use it because they didnt had a refund policy …only replacement for 7 days…. So i think for this price or lower ,there would be some goods brands and similar kind brands which had more specifications …and i think the people who posting good reviews here ,are doing for cross-beats 1 month gaana subscription gift ..might be..anyway i dont want that too..so this is it..and battery backup.if you call even 1 call ,your battery will be drained in maximum 3or 3&half days",Helpful,4

Functional but inaccurate," After a lots of research I have purchased this watch, but I believe this was a wrong decision. Poor battery back up u need to charge every day.

Loaded with good feature but not all are practical.

I wrote to crossbeats, and still waiting for revert",Helpful,3

Moreover, any 2 previous watch faces are not stored, only the recent one along with the default ones are available. Given the price range, expected the quality to have been much better!!!!

I hope that BOAT does not end up with the same fate.

The same happened with me with the SONY product but I got terribly pained running from pillar to post to get a replacement. It NEVER happened. Go for BOAT headphones. They are a value for money.

Bekar hai,Good Product decent sound Quality in this price range its way beyond expectations. Must Buy for Pure Bass Lovers,167,5
Good product,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.
This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)
Pros
Decent build quality
Excellent sound quality
Apt for watching movies.
Soft cushioning
Mic
Good quality cable
Cons
External noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).
Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.

On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2
In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .
For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.
Comfort
I have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.
Build quality
The plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.
Summary
Overall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)
Audio quality 4/5
Bass 3.8/5
Value for money 4/5
Comfort 4/5
Build quality 3.7/5
Thank you for your time.",51,5
Bad battery backup,"The Boat bass heads really live up to their name by providing amazing Bass for music lovers.
Pros:
1. The design is stylish, especially the white one.
2. The headphone is easily foldable making it convenient to carry.
3. Mic for calls.
4. Excellent Bass.
5. Very Cheap (Bought for around 900 during sale).
6. Durable and lengthy Cable.

Cons:
1. You cannot wear it for more than one hour, beyond which your ears start hurting due to the tight design.
2. Slight distortion at 100% sound levels.",39,5
Read my review to avoid ear pain,"I got this headphone for 599.
the build quality of this thing is pretty good it feels solid
Bass is amazing and overall quality of the sound is also nice no doubt.

I am very satisfied with boAt's after sales services.
my Headphone got an issue with sound (unfortunately) don't worry that doesn't mean you will also have the same issue it was just a 1 in million case
so I went to service center and without asking a single question they got me replaced with another headphones.

one more thing I have to mention that you may feel discomfort after wearing the headphones for quite long, because it is slightly tight, may be eventually it will get loose.",59,5
Just Go for it,Awesome Sound but jack is not gold plated!,36,5
Highly recommended,"Everything is good about this headphone. The clarity, noise reduction, bass is all perfect. However after using it for a month the left side stopped working. I raised a complaint with BOAT and within 2 weeks I got a replacement. I appreciate the customer service by BOAT.",15,5
Better than contemporary brands,"Editing this review after 10 months, so starting with the pro's

So the Audio quality is good you'll get surrounding feel where it's needed & if you are bass lover then you will like it very much, watching Hollywood movies on it feels great.

Build quality is also good, most of the components made with plastic and then some metallic & the cushions are soft and their material quality is also good.

Now the cons

even though its cushions are soft this headphone is painfull for your ears if you are using it continuously, headphone fits much more tighter on your ears than it has to be so thats why...

I was using this headphone with Lenovo vibe K4 note and suddenly it stopped working with it, it was working fine with every other device but stopped working on my device, even my device working well with every other headphones even i tried another bassheads 900 and it was working with my device but my bassheads 900 stopped working with my phone... i know its strange.
Then few months later right side of headphone stopped working and then soon after left side gave up.

Boat seems very good build quality and sound quality but i experienced 8 out of 10 headphones of boat stops working after some period, But the best thing is if your headphones gets any issue within 1 year then you'll get brand new headphones from Boat, you just have to register product and ask for replacement with details of your headphone issue.
Even i got replacement for my product & it's been 2 years since i purchased this headphone and they are working super fine although i had to replace them once because of issue mentioned above.",31,5
Worth It - Buy it now 😊,"Good looking headphone with mic.
Sound quality is awesome",37,5
Good for pubg... And has a good grip,"Cons:
1. This is definitely not a bass head set, it's low medium bass.
2. This is more a treble responsive headset
3. Further this is not an Active noise cancellation headset, infact no lt even noise isolation headset.
4. The bass response is aggressive on certain mid to high frequency bass range which gives a pretty harsh thud on your ear.
5. I have a low end 10 driver BA, which is atleast 10 times better with bass and noise isolation..

Pros
1. Pretty cheap on Amazon in the pricing (pocket friendly)
2. The metal connector with spring is premium quality.
3. The overall product build and feel is premium.
4. The mic is pretty responsive and works well.
5. It can be used for long conf calls as the material is soft on the outer ear and it's adjustable.
6 the gauge of wire used is extremely thick and tangle free which is great at this price.
7 There is no noise induced by brushing the wire against fabric or ones body which is a plus.",34,5
Review of Boat headphone,"I brought this headphone for 750 Rupees. It's really easy to use and I like the sound quality of it. but the only one negativity is that it's very lightweight so from my point of view it can break very easily so should not put it down.
They gave this headphones with one year of warranty card so let's see how long it will be in good condition!! .and one more thing that It has good ratings and more then 30 thousand people brought this products that's why I believe it and brought it .( when its gets problem or not working that time I will update again about this headphones ) otherwise value for money.",406,4
Happy customer review after one month use,"This Boat Ear phone of mine stopped working in the Mid of April 2020. It did'nt strike me then to check for the warranty period due to this Covid-19 lock down. Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year. It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know.",262,4
Mind Blowing...,The sound quality is excellent but it hurts the ear lobes after wearing them for 30 mins. Need to put extra cushioning the ones available are not enough. Also it does not have the volume buttons included.making it difficult. Otherwise it's a good buy.,113,4
Must Buy,"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).
For non-music produces (normal people):
This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.

For music producers and mixing engineers:
I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don’t buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.
Hope this helps :)",79,4
Unbiased review,To be honest you guys this headphone sound quality is horrible too much treble I see all other people claiming it has a allot of base but no I’m a base lover there’s no base if you higher up the volume it hurts the ear I didnt expect this I wanna exchange already! This was my first headphone I purchased and Im totally disappointed since I use my apple earpiece it sounds much better than this headphone such a waste of money ! Now another issue it stop working within a month and there is no option to replace also this is a horrible experience ever like thus are the worst thing I’ve ever bought online. Don’t buy it amazon lies!!! There was no option for warranty since they didn’t gave any bill or nothing !!,282,4
Best Bass Heads.... But,"Probably the best headphone in the market for under Rs. 1k as of now.
Build quality is as one would expect from a budget headphone, but i have definitely seen worst even at around Rs 1000 category. Ear coushions are ok, not as soft as i would prefer them to be, but on bad either. The mai issue if you ask me is that the headphones are little lose on the head, and no, i dont have a small head, i have average head size, i would have liked it a little bit tighter.
Coming to sound quality, as i said before, these are the best headphones under the 1k price category. But you should not forget that these costs 600 inr only. So dont go expecting the sound output like that of good lower end headphones which costs Rs. 2000+. The lows and mids are decent, but as you increase the volume, you can feel the just a little bit of distortion and at full volume, you can tell that base is overpowering the treble but that too is not as clwar as you would like it to be. But then again, you can not get anything better in under 1k price category.
So yeah, if your budget is under 1k and you are fine with a wired on-ear headphone and has a slightly bigger head, then this is the only choice for you as of now.",18,4
Worth it!!,"Good product overall, but the ear pads are too large and the sponge is a bit unbreathable, comparing to Motorola Pulse 2 at similar proce point , clearly my preference would be Motorola Pulse 2 over this product.
I also feel a bit heavy/louder sound on the right earpiece compared to left one. But that might be clearly a problem with my hearing.
I miss the feature of a completely detachable and replacable headphone cable in this product , which is present in the pulse 2 which makes it really convenient for repairs and long life. If the cable is damaged in pulse 2 you can simple buy an aux cable and you headphone will be good as new. Also the detachable feature protecs the cable from tearing in case of a sudden jolt as the cable simply unplugs in motorola pulse 2.
I wish this feature will abe also available in boat headphones soon enough and that they also make thw ear pads more soft and breathable for extra comfort.",29,4
Jack is not gold plated,"Headphones have become quite the necessity in these pandemic days of online existence. Whilst they might look sturdy, the majority of them end up looking the worse for wear because of the constant use and contact with sweat. they also develop all kinds of problems, such as the sound coming only through one ear, or crackling, sooner rather than later. No headphone of mine, irrespective of price, has survived for more than two years. This one was also no different. Had to discard it after two years because the sound stopped coming. Before that, there was an odd problem where the head phone took over the YouTube controls and the video would start and stop randomly. Battery life wasn't also all that great.",One,4
Everything is good about this headphone,"These are simply the great headphones in the price range. Sound is nice. I'm using them from 1.5 years. But the major problem is the size of the headphones. Due to small size, you cannot wear them for long time.

About problems:

o You can't wear them for a long time due to their size.
o Few days ago, there was some issue and I cannot hear sound properly from both sides. Every time I have to adjust the wire.

If you have big sized ears then this won't be a right choice for you. Else, you can just go for it.",3,4
Editing this review after 10 months. 🎧,"These headphones have good sound quality. But the biggest problem is the comfort level. I and my family members (a total of 4 ) cannot wear this headphones for over 15-20 minutes, after that one starts to get external ear pain, there is definitely something wrong with the design of this headphone. The sound is good, one need not go over level 10/100 in a laptop.
Ear pain after 15 minutes is the biggest problem with this headset. Overall not a very good buy at Rs.800 as I cannot return it, somehow have to live with it or give it to some kids.",5,4
Fab bass,"I was advised by the doc not to use ear phones that go inside the ear, so I opted for this after reviews. I am using it with the Samsung phone. Not sure if the phone is bad, or network coverage is bad - since i started using it, no one is able to hear anything properly; i am not able to hear them also properly - had to disconnect calls multiple times. Finally, i ditched this headset, and am just holding the phone close to my ear and going without using hands-free.",58,3
This is not a bass head phone,"If You Are Looking Headphones For Long Term Usage Kindly Go For JBL, Sony Or Other Brands They Might Be A Little Costly But It Would Be An One Time Purchase. I Like They Added Metal Casing To Size Stretchers And Made The Aux Cable Weak Enough To Break Everytime. I Already Purchased Same Headphones Twice And Both The Times The Aux Cable Came Out And When You Raise A Complaint They Won't Even Provide Replacement As They Say And I Quote ""Accidental Damage"" Like For Real This Could Happen Twice ? Honestly I Loved Using boAt By The Time Their Product Lasted But Still Such Low Lifespan is Unacceptable. It Just Reminds Me Of The Slogans We Indians Use ""China Ka Maal Hai Chaala Tho Chand Tak Warna Fir Shaam Tak"" (In English : ""Made in China Either Lasts For Lifespan Or Till Evening"") I Hope BoAt Becomes A Complete Made in India Brand Till Then I'm Going With JBL (Which is Not A Complete Made And Manufactured in China Brand).",10,3
Value for money.,"Looks really neat for the price. But that's the only pro I could say about this headphone.
Build seems really flimsy, feels as if it could break with a small accident.
Sound quality is below average. Previously I've had boat bassheads 900 which was in its own league in terms of sound quality. But this one doesn't even come near. Low volume output (probably due to higher ohms of this model compared to bassheads 900's 16ohm) and lacks the boat signature bassy sound. Wire length is really small, bassheads 900 literally had double the length of this one. Also build was so much better on 900's, the headphone foam started coming off that's why I had to retire that one. All in all, buy the bassheads 900 even in 2022, trust me this one is not worth your money.",17,3
Product Life exactly for 1 year Warranty period,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.
The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).
After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).
So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.

2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight.",One,3
Good buy but hurts the outer ear,"I ordered these pairs mainly for my office work and I was surprised by it's package size. It was so small, but after unboxing and listening to some music I can say that the sound quality was good and bass was decent. The thing that I hated the most was the size of the headphones. They are tiny and will hurt your ears even after 5 mins of wearing these. So, my advice is to skip these ones if your head size is normal or somewhat big. These are basically made for kids I guess.",One,3
Serious review (from a music producer)," Looking good. Sound is awesome.
Wire is very small max 3ft.
Not so flexible. I am using it WFH purpose.",One,3
No base horrible sound quality! If you want an honest rev just read this,"The headphones are alright, the sound quality and bass is ok.
But you can't wear that for very long because the headphones keep pushing your ears. After around 15-20 mins your ears will begin to hurt.
Also, while attempting to wear the headphones if that slips, will directly hit your eye.
Mic is also bad, unless you hold the mic close to your mouth the voice wouldn't be clear.
I wouldn't recommend at any price.

Moreover, the warranty that you get from Boat is useless unless your house is very close to their service center. Their customer care never responds. The service centers are located so far away that you'll need to spend more money in travelling than the price of the product.
Highly disappointed in Boat.",One,3
Good on ear headphones for the price,"The build quality is good, happy with that, good packing BUT the overall sound is very bad. Has no highs, hardly any mid, just a lot of bass. The over all sound quality is kinda muffled and low ranged. Unless you really boost with an eq aligned heavily to mid and highs you won't like the sound. I made a mistake and bought 2 donated one already. Suggest you not buy if you want good balanced sound. Ordered 2 together and got them in different time lines not happy with that",One,3
Overall good product but not as good as motorola pulse 2,"If you're the kind of person who gets headaches from wearing earphones but needs music to work or focus, you might buy this because it's only 150 grams. After like 6 months of use the headphones still exert an insane amount of pressure onto your ears, and the weight barely goes to the top of your head. I've tried everything and every size but it always makes my head pain.

Plus, even when it's tight it will probably fall off when you're doing pushups or something. The button is pretty flimsy. Not recommended.",2,3
Not very reliable after some time,"Pros-
Looks

Cons-
Isolation
Sound quality is below average
Mids are muffled
Bass sounds empty
Won't be able to hear footsteps very clearly
Overall not worth maybe spend more
- used these headphones on my laptop with DTS X ultra still sounds bad.

Obviously the seller will tell me to go to BoAt service center which is in mumbai city as shows google map and I live in Pune city.

Too Tight on the Ears,I had just got this headphones day before yesterday and by seeing them i was happy as they look cool ...But honestly i will tell u that as i wear these headphones like just for 2-4minutes while listening songs...my ears start paining and i remove them but still pain was there for a long time for that day .but yeah song quality is good but still they pain..now today i had request for return of this item,2,2

BoAt i request you to take this HeadPhone back and you dont have to provide me the money also , if possible i will provide -100 start rating to this product.",3,2
"Very avoidable if you have a little more money, look for other options"," After using for 3 continuous hours, my take on this headphone.
1. Worst part is you won't be able to return the product, only replacement, else I would have returned it for sure.
2. Bought it thinking I will get thumping bass, but actually it's only average.
3. The sound output is crisp but low.
4. Noise cancellation got cancelled during manufacturing.
5. Feels overpriced being wired with no thumping bass.
6. Tried smule singing, it is giving hiss sound too much. So not for karaoke singing.
7. Watching movie on phone is good experience.
8. For good output of sound, you need to put volume of your phone above 60% which is too much.
9. Average headphone with brand name.
Final verdict: Don't waste your money if you are buying it for thing bass.
Listen to me or repent later on. By the way, you are welcome!",Helpful,2
Terrible fit,"Please don't buy this, The product was good, worked well for two weeks. Then suddenly mic was not working. We tried contacting the customer service for Boat. But no response. Service center also not picking up call. Don't know what to do with this product now, as can't return also already crossed the return timeline due to followup with customer service since three weeks.

I can't take this and go for a service centre to my nearest town which is 90 km away from my place of residence. Only thing I do is I purchase another headphone either from Sony or Phillips. I advice all not to go for boAt headphones. They are not reliable. This is my experience",1024,1
Wish to return the product.,"I bought these headphones (in fact 2 of them, Red as well as Black) as part of the prime day’s sale, which further reduced the price by ₹500 to ₹1499. I must say, go for it without a shadow of a doubt.

SOUND: It’s been 3 days since my purchase. Been testing it extensively. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is super powerful. I previously owned Sony XB550AP which I bought for almost ₹2700. This Rockerz 550 is better in every dimension!

The sound when used wireless is slightly better than when used with the included wire. The difference is really not noticeable until you turn up the volume near max. The difference in sound is actually Bass. When wired, it seems to have more volume than bass.

BATTERY LIFE: Since it’s only 3 days I can’t surely say anything about battery life but I charged it fully and now I’m using it for almost 2 days now still it has almost 80%, after few hours.

CONNECTIVITY: Pairing is super easy. Once paired, it automatically gets connected even after turning it off and then on. Bluetooth range is excellent.

MIC: The built in microphone is good for calls. Not so good for games like PUBG.

LATENCY: The latency is non existent as far as videos are concerned but you can very slightly notice it while playing games (not a deal breaker by any means).

COMFORT: Super comfortable. Sits on your ears very well and covers it perfectly to give you good noise cancellation. It might start sweating around ears after few hours due to the shape of ear cups but that’s not an issue for me personally.

I think I covered almost every aspects. Trust me, you’ll fall in love with your purchase and this product.

UPDATED REVIEW after almost 3 months of extensive usage:

Very happy. No change to what I said on the day of purchase. Still feels new! Battery backup, if anyone is wondering, is really good even after almost 3 months. Easily lasts 2 days of my usage which I think is heavier than an average user and can actually last 3 days if I’m super lucky. Trust this review blindly and you’ll never regret. 🤙",213,1
Okayish...,BoAt gives us a good quality sound than sony headphones,140,1
Bad bad bad quality,lokking nice and desing is very good but during lockdown not able to getting product MRP,95,1
One Star,"Got this on the prime day exclusive sale. For Rs. 1498 u cant get a better deal than this.
First i will come to the build. The entire thing is well cushioned. It is comfortable on the ears. No pressure on the ears like u just have to put it off even if u don't want to. The ears will sweat a little it's true but that is because they cover the entire year. The headband does not feel heavy at all on the head. There is no problems with the connectivity at all. It only took a few seconds to connect to my iPad air 3 and my realme 5 pro (mentioned the model so that angone having these model can buy it worryfree)

Second the sound. The treble is a bit low but the base is on point. It comes both with a 3.5mm aux. So playing Pubg with this is no issue. With Bluetooth connectivity u will find latency but with the wire, footsteps and everything are clear af. There is noise cancellation but don't expect like those of bose. Obvio the price point does vary a lot. But for this range this is too good. I am satisfied with my purchase to the highest point. Just get it!!!",37,1
After 30 days microphone not working,Very comfy i hae 1 piece,14,1
Painfull,"So I've been using them for 2 days now, the sound quality is amazing (both bt and aux), noise isolation does work, for me it lasted 18 hours at 60% volume, it actually only takes 2 hours for a full charge (5v 2A adapter), for those who are wondering about the audio latency, there's no delay on most apps, for some games you might find a 1 second delay, but then again you can use the aux cable and it works fine. When you connect the aux cable you'll notice how it only detects the headphones and not the mic on the headphones, but don't worry i tested it and the mic works fine (both bt and aux). It's a great product for the price, considering the fact that it just released i do recommended you to buy these, just note that though it now says 1999 you can get them for 1500 whenever there's a sale.",11,1
"Not recommended, wastage of money."," This one is the best in allrounder
Pros 1) this one have over the ear means full movie no pain

4) battery according 2 uses

3)cant feals like 50nm drive
4) you can hear and your room partner can also heares the songs. 😝😁",18,1
Distorted sound and poor quality headphones,"Bought the RED version model. Design is lit as Hell.
Sound quality is lit with Bass, little bit of mid and also treble.
A bit heavy in weight.
No lags in connectivity.
Comfortable to wear, as ear cuffs are soft.
After long hours of use, heats up the ear but it doesn't matter if you are in the air conditioning.

Worth every Penny. No regrets.
My OnePlus Dolby Atmos feature enhances the experience.",26,1
very rubbish product,"One problem with this because I thought of that first time I am using on ear earphones (🎧) I fill it is slipping and irritated for few minutes and when I listened to the music 🎶 beats and bass is super.phone calls and stream purpose it is good for sound and comfortablity is less due it is heavy compression and slipping down due to weight.
So overall it is good to use for less time and not comfortable for longtime users.",1719,5
Disappointed by the performance,"Got the headphones on its release date for a price of 1350rs and it is definitely VFM at that price!!

Pros :
- Very comfortable and soft cushioning albeit a little heavy
- Clean treble and good bass(bass lovers won't like this headphones as it's not bass boosted)
- very good bluetooth range
- great battery life
- VFM
- mic quality is surprisingly decent
- noise isolation is good but not great

Cons :
- the stitching on the foam feels a bit gentle, and the headphones creaks when flexed... so not sure about the long term reliability
- 50mm drivers is a gimmick! I used Sony xb450ap before and it's 30mm drivers were better in every way. But it's also 2x pricey and is wired.. so, you get what you pay but don't get fooled by the marketing...
- Not a con, but this headphones is not for bass lovers. Bass is good but not prominent/boosted.",512,5
Don't Buy,"These over-ear headphones sound great with thumping bass and clear vocals along with good noise cancellation and bluetooth connectivity. It also has a really good build quality with eye catching looks and texture. The mic quality is also excellent and good for video conferencing calls or recording music/karaoke. However what the makers at boat forgot to focus on, is the ergonomics! I couldn't wear these headphones even for 5 mins as the pressure of the ear cups was too much, causing pain at the ear and neck region. Hence I returned these headphones. Hope boAt concentrates more on the ergonomics next time before launching any product!",267,5
Poor quality- DON'T BUY IT,"I bought this headphone on prime day sale for 1500/- . For this price range these are really good. I will divide this review between pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Unboxing experience was good it has every basic thing aux wire and cable for charging.
2 . Build quality: This is the best feature of these headphone. The pads are quite comfy . It was little on heavier side but distribution of weight is good, it does not feel heavy on use. The buttons are made of plastic but they felt tactile. Overall it looks sturdy
3 . Great design , as portrayed in the picture. The patterned pads gives premium feel.
4 . Sound quality : The most important part of any audio product. I am no audiophile but i have tried several budget products and some high end products ober years so this might be helpful
The balance of sound is good , the songs appear pleasing with a accentuated lows . It will do wonders if you like heavy bass.
The mids aren't that great and sometimes they felt crushed by the overpowering bass. Instrument seperation is good and one can make out different instrument playing in the background but again they are little overpowered by bass. I know this is asking too much but boat should give a manual controller to decrease the bass like skullcandy crusher. Highs are above avg and the experience was quite enjoyable when when we were listening songs. When I was watching movies I could make out the dialogues spoken by the characters and the movie watching experience was quite enjoyable too . Overall it's a great sound experience for the price .

5. Battery : No complaints here ! Great battery life . I don't know the actual backup but it lasted a week after charging it fully.

6. it connected to my phone pretty easily and the there was no drop in connection even if I move a little away from the phone.

Cons
1. The bass is little overpowering for my liking. If you can tweak using equilizer then you can find the perfect balance between all three mids highs and lows.
2. It has micro-usb in 2020 which is little outdated.
3. The buttons could have been a little better and while turning on the headphones there is a voice which says turned on sound is little loud even when you decrease volume.

Hope you find it helpful!",92,5

I AM NOT A BUYER," I just bought this today and the built quality is satisfactory. I previously bought airdopes 201 and boatstone Bluetooth speaker and became a fan of boat. Now coming to this product, I liked the camouflage design and went after it directly without looking other options. Fortunately the color is as good as in this picture. Any camouflage fans? GO FOR IT!!! The only problem I face is after long use my ears are sweating due to the leather earcup and it's just unbreathable. My ears can't breathe. It becomes uncomfortable. You cannot take this and go for a morning jog or use it when there is no power, because it will cause sweaty ears and I fear what if the sweat just damages my earphones. They should probably make the earcup a little smaller or change the material or an open back for air flow. But it's unlikely. If you have no problem with this then definitely go for it! Worth the money!",20,5
Rockerz 550 Rocks!!!!!!! (Detailed review)," I loved sound quality❤️ the battery backup is aslo really good🔥 the only thing I didn't liked about these was the sound leakage.....when you listen on above 60% the sound leakes.

Awesone,"Its been in use for almost 10 days and gotta say, the battery is phenomenal. Idk the exact hours of playback but I guess it lives up to the marketing 'cause i have been using it for music, watching movies and games on my laptop and mobile alternatively for these 10 days and it has drained just now. And for a fact, it came with a 90% charge and i used that till now, so this is my first time charging it and it was blazing fast. I think it charged in less than 2 hrs or even in just an hour and half. Also it was completely in wireless throughout.
Battery 10/10

Thanks to the design the noise cancellation is superb. Can't say the best but for a passive NC type, this is in the ""too good to be true"" category.

Sound was a little dissapointing here, on frequency tests, 15000Hz was the maximum it produced and there were small electric crackling and static noises but it was minimal. It is stereo and there wasn't any lag ever that I noticed, even when in the brink of range. Average user would be more than satisfied with this product but those pitch perfect tune lovers should go elsewhere. Bass was also great enough.
Sound quality 8/10

As far comfort, it depends on individual user as its a bit tight on the head so people with larger head would feel discomfort within 15 minutes of use, for others you can use it for continued 2 hours without discomfort and you can use it longer if you periodically took it off for a little break in between those hours, to get a 4-5 hours of comfortable use. And remember i said it was tight? Well, it gives one more problem, when you wear it around your neck when not in use, it feels like something's clutching your front throat. It's kinda a irritating feeling. And also three's the sweat issues. If you aren't in a well ventilated place, you will feel sweat all over you ears and dripping down your neck after about 20-25 minutes. And for those SPECS people, for some thicker frames, it hurts, yes, but for most normal thinner frames, it isn't much of a problem.
Comfort 7.5/10

FINAL VERDICT
This is a go yeah kinda headphone for the price it is selling. You can buy it without hesitation for normal usage but for the pitch perfect music lovers (those find even a minuscle difference in bgm's), go elsewhere. This ain't your game. The same for people with thicker glass frames and big heads, search for something that suits you.",18,5
Detailed review,"Brought it for 1,500 during sale, it is value for money
The headphone produces nice sound, at 60-70% volume, not so great bass, but decent.
The headphone is a little heavy.
Disappointed because it does not dual blue-tooth pairing, or you can not be connected to blue-tooth and aux at the same time.
Used it for a couple of hours, got pain in jaws because the headphone was tight, may be it will fine after continuous usage, when the headphone will loosen.
Can be used for a couples of hours, but not for long duration.",16,5
Superb in budget.,"Not bad, but price should be much lower because of the fact that it's made in China else it has no meaning if China made products of Indian brands are charged so much in India. I would be happy to pay this price for 100% Indian product but not China made product, even if the brand is Indian.

About Sound Quality:
- Low Frequency (Bass) output is much low compared to other BT headsets brands I have
- Clarity of sound is good
- Loudness is sufficient

About BT Connectivity:
- I am experiencing broken sound if the distance is beyond 6ft in clear sight arrangement and with 100% battery. Other BT works absolutely fine much beyond this hence I feel this is something to be concerned of as the supported distance seems to less. I used with my Sony 65"" Smart TV. With Laptop it seems to work well

About Build:
- Design is good, though its bulky but smart
- Comfortable on ears
- External noise is not suppressed, may be max 30% is suppressed.

I hope Boat gets some good acquisition deal(s) from Shark Tank India which would help improvise the products and also make it 100% indigenous :)",163,4
Best Headset. Hands-on review. 🔥😎🔥,"Using for listening to music. Oh Yes!!
Taking Calls, BIG no no !!!
During calls, the person at the other end couldn't hear a thing. Tested with a couple of calls. The results were all pathetic. Hope the mic do exist as claimed. I could hear well though.
Passive noise cancellation is similar to other over the ear headsets.
Build quality is decent for the price.
My kids love them though!!
If you like, buy only during the sale or with good offer.",68,4
NOT COMFORTABLE FOR FIRST TIME USER'S,"Contents in the box: User manual, warranty card (1 year), aux cable, headphones.
Headphones come with 50 mm drivers, bluetooth 5.0, AUX cable support.
The headphones are very heavy (250 gms). A good amount of padding is done which makes it comfortable to wear, but it puts a lot of weight on your head and neck so can't wear it for long period of time.
The build quality is poor. After using for some time the head band starts creaking and making noise which is annoying.
The sound quality is very good. Sound is loud and clear. Everything sounds bass boosted, and sometimes feels unnatural.
The battery backup is better than expected. Lasts for days with moderate usage. Charges to full in an hour. Lasts long.
Latency is same as an average wireless headphones. You will experience lag in latency dependent tasks such as gaming and video calls.
Once connected the range is good but facing difficulties in connecting to phone and laptop.
Noise cancellation felt okay at first but with regular use it has decreased.
AUX cable is bad quality and loose fitting although long enough.

Pros:
Loud and clear audio
Good amount of bass
Great battery life
AUX support
Good amount of padding

Cons:
Poor build quality
Sometimes bass feels unnatural (too much)
Very heavy
Not foldable/portable
Connectivity is not good.",46,4
Amazing VFM over ear headphones and not bass heavy," Hinge that pivots the headset broke as I accidentally dropped it. It’s designed so complicated, that I can’t even stick it back with feviquick or even M-seal. So.. since I can’t hang it to my ear, It’s just electronic junk in my cupboard.

If used carefully unlike me, headsets are decent. Little too bassy but not terrible.

2 stars for built quality, 4 stars for aound quality.",5,4
Great sound but uncomfortable to wear!,"Best ever crystal clarity i have ever heard from any over head headphones.🔥🔥🔥

But most importantly don't buy these if you are true bass lover and need thumb in ear for every song.

Built quality and comfort are best in this segment but i honestly feel they are bit overpriced for 2k boat should have launched at 1.5k.

Even with 50mm driver bass is the most weakest point.

But watching movies and YouTube, Netflix is 🔥🔥🔥
You will be able to listen small details in videos.
If you don't want bass but clarity then don't give any other thoughts.

I even had zebronics zeb duke and boult pro bass boost they are beast when it comes to bass output but they lack clarity by just 20%

Lows and mids are clear than any other in this segment.

Suggest you to buy these only at 1.5k for 2k they are dammn over priced.

Battery life is tooo good for 28hr+ than claim.

You can also twist and rest on chest when not needed.

Sound leakage at 90 level it's 10% but really you will listen these all around 70% volume.

Me personally ☺️ was able to use them for 3hr+ continuous.

Even one big advantage that non other offers under 2k is comfort 10/10,After wearing for longer session other headphones makes some inner pain feel like vacuumed ear or pressured but these problems were not at all present.

And one big importantly BOAT has great After sales service than any other india lifestyle brand no worries as they provide free pickup and drop service at your home.

It's all indian brand but MADE IN CHINA.
But all headphones india are made in china up under 2k
Boult Boost and zeb Duke are great alternative for this if you don't get 550.",7,4
Bang for bucks!!,"This is an over-ear headphone and as for all budget over ear headphones, the primary priority is comfort. But this headphone is miserable on that front. The ear cups are well padded and accomodate my ears perfectly. But the clamping force is too much. There is also something about the design that exerts more pressure on the lower base of my ears. I had watched a few reviews on YouTube, where they also mentioned this problem. So, I kept the headphones for stretching using a cardboard box and 3 books. This could reduce the clamping force over a few days. Also, it can grow comfortable over time. Personally, I find Sennheiser HD 206 to be more comfortable at this price range (having used it before), New Republic Starboy is also a good option for comfort, according to reviews.

Update- I got a replacement but this one was comfortable (not much clamping force). But unfortunately, there's a issue while connecting the aux cable. The left ear cup become louder. Returning due to this. But overall, it's a really good earphone.",5,4
Bad build,"Well the whole noise cancellation stuff is just for advertisement and to get along with the trend in headphones these days. It amounts to nothing.
The headphones sound pretty muddy too.
I paid 2k for it. For that price, they are excusable. The fit is actually perfect for me. I wore it for 8 hours straight today and tbh the only thing that made me uncomfortable was the fact that my ears got hot which isn't even the headset's fault lol
I listened to ASMR while sleeping and these are actually pretty comfortable to sleep in too.
But honestly, if you're getting this for even a rupee over 2k, I'd say SKIP IT. If I had paid 5k for it (original price) I would be really angry. But since I paid 2k, I feel like I got my money's worth.",6,4
"Connects with 2 simultaneously, play pause works with every app (pc or phone)","This is my first bluetooth headset,
I'm much more comfortable with wired one's.... But i had a change of mind and purchased this as it has two connectivity options.
Connectivity through aux cable has and max. Impedance of 32 ohms. thanks to 50mm drivers.
Means, quality of the sound is good through Aux Connectivity
But, I have faced issues with the bluetooth Connectivity
Best thing I noticed is that it can connect to both laptop and mobile phone,
but sometimes it doesn't connect to anyone of them for a while.
Coming to the Battery backup, U may forget about it
I have used 8 hours non-stop with both laptop and mobile just after unboxing and it is still at 60%
Build quality is good, not that great
Comfortable ear cups
Overall Great product at great price.

My ears can't breathe 🥶 👂,"I bought this at sale for 1499 this are one of the perfect headphone i bought
1. It has decent sound good for soft music lovers but still has love bass than my boat rockerz 400
2. Battery life is really beast , after listening 2 to 3 hrs daily it looses just 40% battery
3. Ear pads are soft
4. Bluetooth connectivity is superb

Cons
1. Build quality is not up to the mark as its plastic can break easily not for rough users like me since i have broke boat rockerz 400 after 10 months of use so build quality is must for me
2. Bass is not that great and i had to increase it from 10 db
3. It has micro USB cable instead for type c cable which is a down grade and also there is no fast charging

After a week of usage i returned it since there were chances that it may break because its hinges are of plastic as shown in some reviews.",Helpful,4
Really good headphones!,"Initial impression, OVER the ear headphone instead of ON the year, but, due to poor weight distribution, it feels bulky and Uncomfortable to wear.Some of the buyers are facing issues in build quality but I haven't faced anything so far.

The best thing, for this headset is BATTERY life. After 12hrs of usage, the battery percentage was 80% (Volume 70%), which I think, is of another level. Also, I can CONNECT SIMULTANEOUSLY with two devices (PC - mobile), which in my opinion, pretty handy.

However, my biggest cons for this headset is POOR BASS. Also, the sound cracks a lot in high volume (BT). Apart from this, it can't be folded. So, it is difficult to pack, which I don't like at all.

The MIC quality is AVERAGE. Also, there is no ANC (Don't even expect that in this price range 😂). However, passive noise isolation is good.

In a nutshell, it's a balanced product from Boat.",One,4
"10 Days Later! A MUST READ review for this product, as I claim!","I have been using it for last 6 months.
Could have been better:
1. If it had a better Bluetooth connectivity over distance within 10 m range
2. If the internet connection & speed were better when connected to Bluetooth (your Wi-Fi/internet loses its speed and strength when you use Bluetooth headphones)
3. If quality of music were same as when you use wire connection instead of Bluetooth (you experience a good amount of difference in music quality when headphones are used with wire instead of wireless connection)
4. If the wire had microphone, it could have been much more workable (you can't even use buttons & microphone on headphones when connected using wire)
5. If the microphone quality (when wireless) were better it would have improved its functionality

Otherwise its good",54,3

Looks Good!!," Noise cancellation is average, sound is pathetic. Bluetooth connectivity is ok and sound quality is extremely disappointing.
At 70% volume it's a disaster and I'm forced to listen at 100% for even having a decent volume for the feel of it. Boat really spent a lot of buck on ads and promotion on YouTube but in real life it's a disastrous product.the plastic joint near the earcups holding them in the video seems a planned way of limiting the
Earphones have a lot of mileage. If ur a very disciplined user it may survive a year and for a regular person it will break any second. If now for that plastic joint I still would have rated 3 but the join is a careful planning from boat to ensure demand comes back for their supply.",7,3
Review after 20 days of use,"I bought it as a cheap replacement for my Steel Series, and strictly for official teams/skype calls.
What I wanted - A Bluetooth headset with Aux compatibility with a good mic. Comfort wasn't in my Wishlist as this was completely for occasional calls.
The headset volume was ok, both over bluetooth and aux. Very tight on the head that, you feel an instant ""Uncomfortable noise cancellation"".
Tested the mic on the phones, and my voice was nearly audible. Tested it on my laptop, and the other side couldnt even hear my voice. The voice tests shows a max of 32% even when I shouted,
Moral: Dont go by reviews by kids who just need volume and bass.
And Amazon has no direct return policy, So a replacement is being sent. Waste of time",6,3
"Hinge broke easily, it’s impossible to stick it back"," Review after 6-7 month after buying.
The sound quality and blutooth connectivity is good . But the material used is very cheap, the headphone leather starts tearing on its own. Battery backup is good .
Only problem is the product material quality which squanders the product technical quality and product isn't left with the usability if it tears everytime you try to put it on.
Update at 11 months since purchase, the product leather quality is absolutely worst. Don't buy this product.",5,3
Look ing for clarifying sound and comfort then buy these,"Connects to multiple devices at a time 😐 that’s a feature or tech issue I’ve no idea which makes the video and audio non sync and laggy 😒 and when the device gets connected the automatically goes to full volume which makes your ears burst so plz switch on the headphone set and reduce the volume and then keep on to the ears 🙉.
PS: Headphones has 99% SPO2 Lol! Just kidding it’s because of defective oximeter 🥴",4,3
Not much comfortable,"Reviews said it was good. I ordered them now I'm disappointed.
The look is cool, the battery is great and its comfortable.

But the main thing - The Sound quality is not upto the mark.

The bass is low. The midtones aren't clear and sharp. Good if you don't need high audio and for simple use. But I don't think its worth buying. There are plenty other options. Not impressed with the sound. Don't buy this",4,3
Meh.,"The headphone is intact but the box has been torn and and someone has tried to tape it. The instruction manual, documents and all the paper work are missing. Also the aux and usb cable are just carelessly put inside the box. The warranty of the product is also missing.",One,3
Good Experience in a budget,"Have been using the product for about 3 months, almost 12 hours daily.
Key things to note:
1) It's not great but will not do the job most of the time.
2) sometimes you might have to disconnect and connect again to work properly
3) voice will sometimes(40% of the time ) disappear/break during the call, have to do the above process again.
4) Bluetooth connection is good unless you are near rocks/walls/metal poles then for some reason its voice will completely break apart when compared to my 2 years older JBL Bluetooth headset.
5) completely dumb product, multiple device connection feature I will recommend to not use and don't buy if you are thinking of that as a benefit, it's not well built and designed on software end, it sometimes will just crash if you are listening on laptop and call comes on phone.
6) audio is poor on best days and will disappear time to time.
7) using with attached wire is also hard as wire is compartively easily detachable and not bnug fit enough.",2,3
Everything is perfect except build quality,"Audio is great on Bluetooth, also connects very fast. Great range. Also fit very comfortably, no pressure or pain. Design is top notch.
But the 3.5 mm cable is just a showpiece, it fits too tightly and with difficulty into the headphone port first of all, almost as if it's breaking the plastic and metal connector within the headphone port each time you put it in. Audio is terrible with the cable plugged in, with too much loss, distorted signals. Have returned two of these already for the same reason, am keeping this one, Going by past experience, if this is replaced, the product sent may have the same issue again .

EDIT: Works great with a different 3.5 mm cable. The included cable is junk",44,2
BALANCED product with some minor drawbacks.,"After Diwali of 2021 when these guys wanted to show numbers probably for an IPO they suddenly lowered their price and quality.

I had been happy with the quality of boat 510 I purchased 6 months earlier and now was getting 550 for lower price. After 2 months - the older 510 is still working and the newer 550 is struggling to keep bluetooth connection when the distance is less than 1 m

It is anyways imported in bulk from China where expensive components can be replaced at the drop of a hat. I will try to claim warranty and revise my review if there are any changes.",26,2
Could have been better,"The Build quality is very poor, Never purchase this product. It broke in a month even tho I was using my new headphone very carefully. It broke because the plastic used at that point is very weak and cheap.

It look like they have used metal in the head band but that they have just pasted after the rotation point and it serves no Purpose.

I am soo much trapped after purchasing this as they will not give service because it is considered as physical damage nor I can use it anymore. A complete waste of money.",14,2

Just Okay,"Review after using this for 2 weeks :->
1. Sound Quality : trash... My (Rs. 650) skull candy anti sounds way much much better than this thing.
Lows are dead in this headphone, you will never be able to hear the little details, creativity in the songs.
Bass is flat or no base at all , you will feel base only if you play bass boosted audio tracks, beats are very very low , even some beats are feeled bcos of headphone covers the whole ears else there is nothing that these headphone can do .
In one word : sound quality of this headphone is just little bit higher than china's 150Rs. Earphones with some negligible better bass.

2. Weight : this is really really heavy . I have used a lot of headphones but this is the only one which I was unable to wear for more than 1 hour , my neck hurts.

3.At 30% Charge : it starts notifying battery low voice ""oops battery low"" sentence after every minute, which is really annoying if you watching movies, online class lecture, listening song.

ठीक है न बहुत खराब न सबसे अच्छा,"first i would like to comment on the tab market of India. the most peculiar thing I have seen in India is, when a particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible. it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the USA. you watch the prices of chromebooks, tablets, back to school offers in the US and compare them to India and it feels extremely unbalanced. after the pandemic there was a huge surge in the tab market and tier 1 brands started delivering garbage for 20000 rupees. snapdragon 400, old mediatek, 4gb ram, abysmal non ips screen for 20k just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students. THIS TABLET BRINGS THE REVOLUTION.

I am no student, but bought this for day to day use and I am an user of the normal big bezel 7th gen iPad, so my review will be comparative in nature. also i bought this at 23000 rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price I paid.

1. if you are planning to buy an iPad, just buy it considering 64gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios. you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updates.
this tablet if compared spec vs spec give a good challenge to the ipad FOR 23K RUPEES. even for 27k it is fine.
2. build is fine although I put a tempered glass on the 1st day itself. back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy.
3. the IPS screen is really good, there is no backlight bleeding, no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background. I am used to OLED screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but OLED is impossible at this price. the screen is better than my 7th gen iPad's display. it is brighter, has more punchy colours, blacks are darker. on top of that 120hz panel, hdr certification, dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption. it would be a great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it. display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet.
4. snapdragon 860 is fine in a market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market. hence I say if you don't want this just buy an iPad but don't buy any other android tablet at 20-30k price point. all are trash. 860 was fine with all those games which rule the market today. it has less pixels to push than in a phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless.
5. i can't comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now i don't see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming. it has a 22.5 watt charger in the box although it does support 33 watt charging. the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my iPad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has a bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers.
6. the camera is okayish, just like most tablet cameras. the iPad has even worse cameras. for document scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful. it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in 25k range tablets.
7. the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers. they are loud, have depth, are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage. they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost 40-50k. they will hit you as a massive surprise. i did not at all expect such good speakers. they seriously outmatch those cheapo 700Rs boat, goat, mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes, separation and low end. of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantity.

coming to the cons-
1. was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldn't find a place for a 3.5mm jack. not even a dongle in the box. they should seriously stop copying apple's wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates. although I mitigated the issue by using portable dongle DACs like shanling ua1, ibasso dc03.....etc which i generally use with even my phones and my PC coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some LG phones with quad dac. i am an audio enthusiast so i spend money on such products and you need not. although it works with my old MI A2 dongle just fine.
2. for 23000 rupees I don't expect the pen and people who are expecting a pen with 23k tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as Indian tablet market and its offerings but for 27k they could just offer a bundle where you pay 1k-2k rupees more and get the pen as an add on.
3. the accessory market might not be that vibrant. already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands. there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at 5000 rupees LOL. the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and i don't trust those type of cases.

one more issue that I would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has a tendency to creep up prices by 500-1000 rupees within a month or two by doing the good old ""GST BRO"". so if it ever reaches 28-29k for the 128gb version just close your eyes and buy an iPad with card discounts.
so, in a nut shell for 23K it is was no brainer, but even for 27K it is a really good deal considering what its competitors are.

Koi feature kaam nahi krega .,"Pros :-
-Snapdragon 860 processor is a killer deal with this tab in under 25000 Rs
-120 hz refresh rate
- 8720 Mah Battery - this battery easily would ladt for 4-5 days in a single charge with moderate usage 8-10 hours of heavy usage can be done in this tab
- Camera Quality is Decent
charges in 2 hrs with 22.5 Watt charger
- Display quality along with the aspect ratio is too good

Cons :-
- There is no AMOLED display with this tab
- No support for increasing storage
- We get a 22.5 Watt charger even though the tab supports 33 Watt fast charging
- No support for LTE (U cant insert a sim card in this tab , and it only works on Wifi)

These are some of the things you guys should know before purchasing this tab, I got it for 23499 since I have HDFC credit card and got 1500 /- off on the Cost price which was 25k.
For me this tab is a great deal and I havent faced any problems with this tab yet",2,1
Worst,"I bought this mostly for it's note taking capabilities but without the Xiaomi Smart Pen I am unable to use for that purpose and hence 1 star. The speakers are great. The screen is awesome. If you want this for multimedia purposes it's the best in this price range. Wouldn't recommend this for students like me until they release the smart pen and since there is a no official date as when the pen will be released I wouldn't suggest to buy it at all. There might me a chance that pen is never released.

Edit : 5 Star. Got the pen and used it for a month. My purpose is fulfilled. A suggestion would be to side load samsung notes app. The system note app sucks and others are not quite free.

Edit 2 : Using OneNote Microsoft is way better the sync across devices is sooo good",Helpful,1
Worthless watch," Best Tab under its price segment.
On last 14 days of usage, I have noticed following Pros and Cons
Pros
1. The performance is very smooth, no lag and stutter while switching between app. Heavy games also runs fine.
2. The display is very good with 120hz refresh rate. Colours are also vivid and punchy considering the IPS panel.
3. Battery is also very good, easily giving above 1 day of back up on normal usage.
4. The charging speed is also very good, takes around 100 min from 15 to 100% with 22.5 watt supplied charger.
5. The design and built quality is nice.

Cons
1. It is lacking some features related to connectivity with samsung phones.
2. Pen sold separately and costs around 6000 and its not like samsung s pen which has more features.
3. The screen does not very bright. Looks like max 400 nits brightness only.
4. The sound output is not very rich and deep.
5. MS office is not running well.",One,1

Very Bad Product..No use.,"My first impressions are legit amazzzzzzzing, this tab feels soooo good for any day to day tasks, such as media streaming or note taking. I miss the smart pen, though I guess I'll buy it from mi.com as it may come in stock soon.

Believe me when I say it's display even though is IPS it looks just as good as the Dynamic Super Amoled in my Samsung S21+, color accuracy is too good. Maybe the blacks aren't that deep as any super amoled will have but it's still amaaaaazing to look at. Most importantly the battery life in this thing is well fricking nuts. I love how Xiaomi has pulled off everything in this so well.

Maybe a few missing pieces here and there such as no screen protection, no fingerprint scanner, no always on display, but hey what more do you want in this price range 😄

I myself am a mac os user but feel an android tab goes along just as good as any other ipad, especially when it's this cheap it's a no brainer.

And yes the os in this is completely bloatware/ads free. No nothing nada, anything you want you can add it later via play store.

I love it ❤",95,5
Bad product,"The Tablet is quite good in terms of cost to feature. Its display is as good as an iPad air.
It's a perfect gadget for media consumers and also has a decent chipset with SD 860.

People who don't want to spend 40k+ on apple/samsung can seriously go for this one without a doubt. No issue as such and MIUI is bug-free and bloatware-free as well (which I was looking for). The speakers are good and this is a good tablet considering what android tablets we have in the market right now.
Trust me, this will do the job

Overall its best wifi tablet till now in india at this price range

Some cons. - 1. No headphone jack (as a tab its important give jack ,the output of type c to 3.5mm cable is not like jack sound, quality definitely decrease in type c adaptor)
Note - type c to jack not in box
2. No sim support ( we need sim version also because we want use it like mobile , having problems with wifi always need hotspot on, that increases battery usage of mobile)

3. 33w charger should given in box

Expect thats thing this is great tab in this price range or wait for mi 5 pro sim version next month may it come",7,5
Just wow😍😍,"Satisfied with the price tag of 25499 for 6/256,
Looks great and batter backup is good for me as I am just using it for media streaming (hotstar, udemy, unacaedemy) and picture quality is awesome.

I hate to handle a lagging device, because of Snapdragon 860 and I am using this device for streaming purpose , I have never faced any lag and the flow is very smooth between the apps/videos.
Because of Snapdragon 860 its fast.

5000 rupees for a smart pen is really expensive for a 25000 tab so I have purchased 300 rupees touch screen silicon tip pen in Amazon,this pen is giving 90 percentage accuracy while writing in pdf and I am not worried about the rest 10 percentage of accuracy as I bought it for 300 only 😅.

Audio is loud enough to enjoy the sound.

I will update the miui os versions for next 1 to 1 and half year and will stop then as its proved that xiaomi makes the devices slower through updates to make buyers look for upgrading the device.(this has happened with me in k20 pro case and I have downgraded my miui 12.5 to 12.0.6 to make my mobile behave like a flagship )

I would have been very happy if the screen is amoled but for a price tag of 25499 it has been great when compared to other available devices in market.
Instead of Snapdragon 860 xiaomi should have gone to 870 which will be great.

Price tag is stopping me to think for AMOLED SCREEN, SNAPDRAGON 865/870/888/8GEN1ST,
3.5mm AUDIO JACK",7,5

1. No gps. Still gps based apps works with wifi based location.
2. No external memory support. There is no option for inserting sd card.
What is pointless?
It has a powerful processor to run games in very high resolution, however the usb c doesn't support video output. i.e, if you are a gamer and a content maker, video capture card doesn't capture the video. You have to use inbuilt or 3rd party apps to capture the screen.
Sound is another important parameter for a gamer and this doesn't have audio jack. However you can use a usb c to audio jack convertor for no lag audio.",7,5

Experience & Review

The best tablet under the 30k price range probably stands at 1st place with the above-mentioned specifications
I bought this tablet exactly 2 months back ie On May 6th, 2022. The experience with this tablet is AWESOME we don't feel any lag or shuttering while using this tablet.it is very smooth and fluid.
The MIUI for the table is awesome, we don't see any bloatware much, very fun to use.
The UI is compatible for almost all applications (apps)
The brightness is decent enough to use where ever possible.
The audio experience is fantastic because it's equipped with quad speakers set up in addition it supports DOLBY ATMOS which is the premium experience at this price range.
The display with 2.5k resolution with 120hz fast refreshing rate is fun to use and in addition, it is equipped with DOLBY VISION and HDR10 Support which is the premium touch we can feel these features while using supported videos and in OTT platforms especially using NETFLIX, AMAETCME, HOTSTAR, AND ETC
The build quality of the tab is awesome, the frame is fitted with metal and the back is fitted with a polycarbonate finish which almost looks like Matt's glass finish looks so premium.
The battery capacity is 8500mah with a 33-watt support adopter, but in the box, it comes with a 20watt adopter is pretty much enough I feel.

CONS:-
1. Missing 3.5mm headphone slot.
2. Brightness could have been better.
3. No sim card variant available.
4. The accessories like protection cover(flip cover), screen glass, smart pen were not available in Amazon, Flipkart, etc,,
5. The accessories like protection cover(flip cover)with an integrated keyboard(2k), and smartpen were available in MI STORE, which was priced highly especially Smartpen(6k).

Overall ratings are 4.8/5.",10,5
Genuine Review,"Speaker are top notch. One of the best sound quality and surround effects. The screen is good quality for LCD panel. Performance (SD 860) is good enough, no lags no stutter. Memory is fast. Has clean OS with no bloatware unlike other mi/redmi phones.

Battery life i found to be around 7-9 hr if streaming . Reduces to 5-6hr if you do gaming or any heavy task.

Charging takes upto 1½ hrs from 20-100%. Would have been nice if they had provided 33W charger in the box instead of 22.5W.

Dolby Atmos/vison ,120Hz refresh rate is cherry on top.

*Note: If you are used to any OLED screen you might feel this screen is bit dull and lacks the true OLED blacks.",42,4
The most cost effective android tablet!,"This is the first time a proper Android tablet has been launched. It was mostly dominated by Apple ipad and Samsung's S series(beyond my budget) and budget ones didn't have any proper specifications to boast about.

I bought on the second day of sales with lots of confusion about cashbacks. (6+128)
Coming to the device, it is one hell of a machine.

The processor is a bit old but manages to do the job well. No lag whatsoever.
Sound is not up to the mark on my device. Upwards of 70% gives decent sound. This is problem with my device may be.
Display is amazing... 120Hz is butter smooth... Though Amoled could have been better but you will never miss it.
Audio output through Bluetooth is good and you'll enjoy your music.
If you are new to tablet, then you'll definitely feel the weight. First time when I held the tab it almost fell off.😁😁

Few negatives as well
No fingerprint scanner
No 3.5mm headphone jack😑
No case, cover, tempered glass available.
Pen should have been included... It costs about 6k and cover costs about 2k which converts the whole package to 33k.

I have not spend enough time to comment about gaming and other aspects but it's definitely better than rest of the budget ones.",17,4

✓Cameras are not usefull
✓No software/security update.

Best Budget Tablet - Good Features and new competitor for all,Sound quality is average. Snapdragon 860 is showing it's age here. Normal Videos looks good. Screen is not good enough to play Dolby Vision and HDR content. Accessories are hard to find.,4,4
Excellent,"Let me start off by saying, this is a great a tablet. Good performance, nice screen, good battery life. The issue I faced, and this is quite a big issue for me, is a bug in the Xiaomi software.
This device has L1 Widevine certificate but for some wierd reason, it just randomly disappears and when it does we get bumped down to L3. What that means is streaming services such as Netflix and Prime will only display videos at 480p i.e SD quality. Dolby vision, HDR everything is useless without Widevine certification and this is a Xiaomi bug. If they release a patch for this issue, then it's an easy tablet to recommend, otherwise might want to look elsewhere.",4,4

Xiaomi has nailed it😍," I'm not going to share usual experience or specs that you can find everywhere. I'm going to share something that no one's is talking about and that is it's HDR capability in Dark scenes. It is worst it is useless and i reasearch about it believe me it can't be fixed. Let me tell you why

HDR Content needs brighter display sadly it's IPS panel can't provide that much which results in more darker scenes and it becomes impossible to watch. You can't watch HDR Content. And it's been 7-8 months of global launch still people are complaining about it.. the only fix is to lower your NETFLIX plan so that HDR are disabled and you can watch your show👍👍",One,3

HDR and Dolby Vision videos are too dark,"DONT BUY THIS IF YOUR MAIN PURPOSE IS MEDIA CONSUMPTION. THIS AIN'T WORTH THE MONEY.

Just purchased this 2 days back. believe me, this tablet is very good only in the hardware department. I purchased this for the media consumption and no reviewer is gonna tell you this, but let me be very clear, don't buy this tablet, reason why?
1) The massive 2.5k HD screen is basically useless, you can't stream 4k videos so basically you have to watch every thing on Netflix,prime video, hotstar on 1080p resolution which looks bad on this 2.5k screen.
2) MiUi/BugUi, Netflix and prime video and the rest of OTTs keep on crashing because apparently of a bug in Miui 13, the quality will drop to 480p and the widevine certificate will show as L3, and there is no fix for this.
3) The HDR and the Dolby Vision is purely a market gimmick. Netflix and YouTube looks very dark, you can't even see the character in front of the screen reason cause this tablet has max brightness of 500nits which is not compatible for HDR10.

Close your eyes and go for Samsung/apple tablets. This chinese crap ain't worth it.",Helpful,3
Great tablet only hindered by a Widevine bug,"As compared to Tab 7 FE, this tablet's screen is very bad and poor. It has even poorer viewing angles.

Nice USB cable.,"I bought 2 of this Bluetooth earphones for me & my friend for our daily workout inside and outside. The earphones fit well as I move around during my workout (sprinting, running, exercising etc...). I've tried similar earphones with similar price points in the past.

Not compatible,"The main thing which I found very fascinating about this ptron tangent beats neckbandis that it's battery backup which was 7-8 hours on watching series and just requires 90-100 mins of charging.

Good but hard to push due to defective metal body,"I bought these to run and it was important that they be specifically good for running. And they are great. Exceeded my expectations really. The sound quality is excellent. Far better than i'd expected from this price point. And certainly more than enough for my use case. The Bass is great. The design of the earbuds are also great. They don't fall out that often while running. The bluetooth is great. No drops. The battery life is great. Lasts for a few hours comfortably. And most importantly, they are perfectly symmetrical so it feels balanced while running. This is a huge concern and is one of the reasons I went with this design. I have only just bought them. If there are any longevity issues, I shall update this. If there are no updates, assume it was been working great and I've had no complaints!!

UPDATE: One of the best purchases I have made. This is perfect. All the sweat and wetness does not seem to bother it. Violent flailing about, if I'm running with them out of my ears, have also not been able to destroy it(yet). The sound quality is as good as wired earbuds twice its cost. Gets as loud as you need. Battery life is more than I expected. Does not fall out of my ears. Perfect fit. The earbud turns off automatically 5 minutes after I disconnect the bluetooth and this is amazing because the only button i have to press is the power on button and its great for convenience! This is a great product here. I've been using it for about 3 months now and not even one complaint. Good stuff man. Keep it up.",Helpful,1
Worst usb pins inside got bent in one day,"These Bluetooth headsets are great in this range for both use on iOS and Android with quick pairing.

It Also Has Quick Pairing and Low Latency Streaming. The Mic Quality is Excellent. On The Right Side There's Three Buttons to Control All The Operations of The Headphone.

Don't buy it for long time uses,"I got it for 799/- within 24 hrs. Using it for 10 days now, don't have much complaints. I will sum up in pros and cons after my experience with the earphones. Reducing 1 star for the first CON in my review below.
PROS:
1) Cheaper than some of the other earphone brands with 12 months warranty as well.
2) Good Audio quality, I found it was better sounding than an Over the Ears Headphones I have from Cosmic Byte (G4000). Clear sound and good audio reproduction.
3) Battery life serves good at least for my taste as I am not a heavy user (I generally use it 2hours a day max.). Just FYI, I have charged the earphones twice in 10 days.
4) Comfortable earphones with very less weight and good ear fit.
5) Mic quality for calls is decent, not much noise cancellation for background noise but whatever is sent through is very clear and accurate.
CONS:
1) Biggest con for me personally is that I can't watch online youtube or twitch videos with this one (usually have to go 360p or lower for smoother experience) as it hampers the wifi speed on my mobile when connected to the mobile via bluetooth. This is happening because my wifi router is 2.4Ghz and it is interferring with the bluetooth signal to reduce internet speeds. A simple 5Ghz router would solve this issue, but as I don't have it, its become an issue. Also, I can tell if you run videos from mobile internet then you don't face this issue.
2) Only SBC bluetooth audio format supported hence not the best audio quality.
3) Left and Right ear plugs always confuse me while wearing it on, also the length of left and right side is not exactly the same, slight mismatch is present, which goes to show poor quality checks from the company.
4) Battery life could have been better or atleast charge time should have been reduced. It takes 1.5 hrs charge time for 6-8hrs battery life.
5) Battery indicator is very wrongly calibrated. From 100 to 70% discharging, it takes 5-6 hrs playtime, while from 70 to 10% it takes just 30 odd minutes. This again shows poor quality checks from the company.",380,5
Unable to connect usb to USB port,"Looks wise: Decent

Sound quality: Good

Noise cancellation: Great, as compared to many other branded co. bluetooth earphones this product won't disappoint you.
Even when you are on a call you can hear the receiver's voice clearly and vice versa.

Connectivity: Very easy to connect to your smartphone but you may need to troubleshoot it (mentioned in mannuel) for pairing it with your laptop.

Unique part of this product : Extremely flexible and lightweighted.

I bought this product for Rs.850 but within 2days the price dropped to Rs.800",380,5

4. In packing not mentioned Bluetooth versions.
5. Battery charge is good. Up to 4 hrs.

Excellent product by ptron. U would love this.,"The earphones look good with a smooth design and finish. However, they're a little delicate where the wires exit from the neckband, one feels if pulled roughly might break them. The buttons in this one (unlike ptron's Tangent Bass Plus design which are raised )are in line with the surface so, it can be hard to get the right button sometimes but that's a personal preference. The bass is quite flat and the treble is a little too high pitched for my liking. So, if you're listening to speech for ex you may find the audio a little sharp but music is fine. The battery is good. The max I've got is 8hrs from it with non-continuous usage. Overall a good buy.",230,5
"Well balanced sounding earphones along with light, durable and long battery life","I just received the packet today morning. Rating its build up quality I would give 3/5. Packing was good and very sturdy.
When I opened the box it was little dust in the headphone but not old. Dust maybe due to packing. While joining the Buds, Bluetooth connectivity is still showing in mobile.
The most likely part was the color, I would rate 5/5.

Later after using i will put the review.",313,5
Good battery backup with clear vocals and bass,"Don't expect best in this price segment overall good, noise canceling was not upto that mark, sound quality is say 3 star and fitting is good overall ok ok product. Only drawback is when battery is about die it never indicate and suddenly u will feel call is drop or what.. So its minus in Ptron I don't about the other products of Ptron but in this product I faced issue and secondly when you visit online store to claim extra warranty and when you upload scan on back of box your product doesn't matched with Online website products, so in short you can't claim its better pay extra 300/-and buy from store and claim warranty but through Amazon don't expect that you can claim extra warranty of Ptron.. Beware.",216,5
Great quality neckband,I got the product for just Rs.699 on Amazon morning deal at 9am.The overall packaging was good and delivers adequate sound performance. But the Bluetooth range was disappointing. The connection get lost even within 3m in small obstacles inside my room. The noise cancellation is okay but not perfect if you are in a busy place. Also the bass quality is good not amazing compared to Boat Headsets. The mic sound quality is okay. Overall if you are going for an Indian blutooth headset product under 1k this is your perfect choice.,212,5
Best Purchase,Reviewing this product after one day. Got it for 699 on 6/7 Aug sale. The qc should be done more well as you can see in last pic there are two white spots on the earphone. Sound quality is descent considering the price. Bass is good. Don't expect boAt level bass. But yes it's definitely good. You can feel the thump. Treble is also good. But can find some distortion at full volume. But it nowhere says bluetooth 5.0 on the box and also don't say low latency on the box. Overall decent earphones if you are on budget.,168,4
Perfectly fits my needs: Runner's review,"I'm on a spree for best budget wireless earphones.

Looking at all the positive product reviews, i was tempted to go for this one. I agree may be on few points but the main important thing about earphones is that it should sound well in layman terms.

the sound feels like someone screaming from an old empty well. you hear them but hardly. if Bass, treble are foreign terminology for you then go for it. You may need to pay attention for the lyrics most of the time.",71,4
Great one for BASS LOVERS,After thorough usage I recommend this product to buy only when it’s below 500rs budget. The bass effect is not effective. The drivers may not even10mm or more as indicated in product description page. Battery lasts long as stated. ENC not much effective. Call quality is fine/at par as with other ptron low budget products. Connectivity is sharp. Not tested water resistance. Neck band is of good quality but metal interfacing junctions could have been more solid/tamper proof. Noticed during call it’s not audible even at max volume due to ENC possibly.,43,4
Excellent Bluetooth Neckband,"Detailed review after months of usage.
Audio is fine, but you have to place mic really close to your mouth for the other party to hear properly.
Battery is good one recharge can get you like 2 3 days of juice.

Cons
If you use this with wifi you internet with not work, since both uses same frequency. No YouTube, Instagram, or even surfing, you have to change from wifi to data pack. This is very frustrating as I mostly used wifi.
Calling on wifi or normal call sometimes doesn't work.

I would only suggest you to buy this if you are traveling everyday with no wifi only.",23,4
Tangent beats,This one is my 4th ptron. They tried hard to make it good but on sound part couldn't manage well. Bass is bit muddy. Earplugs size of left and right is not same. Loudness is on lower side may be due to 32 ohm impedance . Microphone is good other person can hear you clear but you can't hear them clearly. Replament window is very less. Only 7 days so I m confused to keep it or replace it,23,4

DELIVERY EXPERIENCE:
1. MISSING ITEM(S): The accessories-pouch was ripped open. I ordered a replacement, but again it came opened. What was taken from it?
2. BATTERY LIFE: Good but when it reaches 30%, it's just a 4, 5 minute game (with 'charge' alerts) until it switches off. (3 starts)
3. OVERALL: I would give it 3 starts.",11,4
Average product,"The product is good and comfortable. I read so many reviews about the bass being amazing, but frankly the bass is just adequate. Better than normal low cost earphones, but no where near what you can call good. I would rate it as average. Voice clarity for calls is good, but the microphone seems to be a problem. People on the other end are unable to hear my voice clearly with this headphone.
If you are look at something under 1000 which is comfortable, then this seems to be a good product for that.",7,4
Bang for the Rupee,"The design is pretty neat and comfort. I like the color and simple operation. However, sound quality is questionable. There is a torn, breaking sound in high pitch (probably due to not good quality of bass). Moreover, microphone is really bad. Often it has disturbance during the call, especially when my phone is near or with movement, and not clear most of the time. Btw, I've received USB-C cable instead of micro USB which is not useful at all.",5,4
Worth buying,"After using these neckband for 10days.i had noticed some things
1-comfortable to keep in ear for long time
2-mic is quite good to use
3-charging time is 3hrs to get full charge and playback time is up to 55hrs
4-pairing with phone is some what delay compared to other products
5-volume buttons are not so big to control
6-led light is so small so we can't view while it is charging whether it is full charge or not,we should go close to see it.
7-I had received a damaged usb charging wire & packing also some what teard.
8-its range is very less of we go to another room it is not working properly the sound gets cuts.
These are the some of them I had noticed and it is budget friendly.Thank you",3,4
Honest Review,"The bluetooth was delivered in good condition, however after buying i get to know that there is no returning policy on exchange- MY MISTAKE. Pls do not buy if ur not sure.
2nd the voice msg whn it connects with the incomin call is so so so low tht if ur driving u'll miss the call.
There is no exclusive about the BASS effect if u really are a music lover u'll be disappointed.
So all in all if ur gifting to someone that should be cheap this is the one to go for...otherwise no no",4,4
Great Workout Earbuds!,"Based on so many positive reviews, I chose to buy it and initially I too liked the earbuds, but just in two days it went off during a call even though it had 60% battery. I tried to start it but on vain. Later I tried to charge and itscharging socket seemed to have loose connection and it did not start charging. Finally, I had to return it.
Other observations:
1. Build quality is poor.
2. Though description here had mentioned as Bluetooth 5.0 but product box had no mention of the same.",184,3
Good purchase,"This earphone is the best , and awsome at this price range .
This was my thinking before purchasing. But when I purchase this i recieved this in well packed manner. I think this is the best one but when I open It and start testing i found that there is very low vocals hearing and music is too high . The contrast of vocals and music not well , it has difference of land and sky. Build quality is good but the overall sound quality is bad only 2 ratings for sound out of 5.",38,3
Decent quality earphones but very delicate,"I have used various PTron headphones earlier also & all the products have good sound quality. But this product buid quality is very good unless very poor sound quality & I have returned the item due to following problem:
1. Sound quality is very poor
2. Volume start in half of the volume
3. In voice call its marginally audible in full volume & works in zero noise conditions
4. Voice cancelation not working at all
5. In crowded conditions with full volume its not audible in phone calls.
Only good things is build quality but the primary function is not upto mark, then its completely wastage of money & its not worth for money.",5,3
Looks Awesome!,"You have to hold the on/off button for a while. The 'ptron bt' announcements can get pretty irritating. And the thing that annoys me the most is that it suddenly disconnects on its own and yet it shows it's still connected on your device. So you have to turn it off and then connect again. Distance between the earphones and your device can be better. But overall an okay product. Would I buy it again? Probably not. I would suggest going for a different company
Edit: I have been using it for 7 months now... And my conclusion is that I HATE IT!!!! The rate of auto disconnect has increased! I can't wait for it to conk off so I can throw it in the trash where it belongs.",4,3
Ok ok product,"Well it is a product that left me with a potential loss of ₹75/- 😤

Got it for ₹725/- after using a coupon, so I was very happy. The delivery was perfect.

Initial Disappointment - After opening the package, I realized the Blue color piece I ordered was different from what is shown in pictures here. Depending on the angle it can appear dark metallic greyish, greenish, bluish or black (handles from where the wires are coming out). But fine I can live with it.

Slow Charging - It was 70% charged when I got it but took nearly 2.5 hrs to reach 100% charge.

Sound quality, bass, noise cancellation is very good and battery life was awesome.
The microphone is also good (but read on). Quite comfortable for ears, no pain even after continuous 4-5 hrs usage.

Fast pairing with mobile and laptop and a solid stable connection with nearly no playback delays. So far so good.

Build Quality - Here is where the disappointment starts. Wires used are thin and appears fragile, gives you a feeling that a slight pull/strech can snap the wire especially at the earphone end (though it's a neckband but it still has wires which can get pulled if you are not careful).

Then I noticed small cracks near white circular lines on the see in the images attached.

Bluetooth Issues - Earlier I said excellent Bluetooth connectivity and no noticeable delays, well the truth is that it is applicable only up to range of 4.5-5.0 meter from your playback device. Go beyond that, there is a huge delay, the voice cracks as if you are playing a badly scratched CD/DVD, any many times total disconnection from your playback device, which obviously is irritating and frustrating.

I am happy that I got the refund but there was a potential loss of ₹75/- as I didn't get another chance to use that coupon nor a new coupon of the same value was provided.

A general tip applicable to any USB powered device (from my own experience over the years)-

When you insert the provided charging cable in the charging port on the device, then if you can see more than 1mm of metal part of the charging cable, then it is guaranteed that either the charging cable or the charging port or both, used are of cheap quality. Although this doesn't necessarily mean your device will stop functioning or get damaged in a short time. It means that the probability of your device getting failed or damaged is high since the parts used are of substandard quality !

So overall it depends on the actual item you received. Some will be satisfied while others would be upset. Given the reputation of Chinese Products, all I can say is Ride Your Luck !",6,3
A budget Bluetooth headset under 800," Its nothing more than a typical Chinese product ""chale to chaand tak nahi to shyam tak. Better products are available in similar range.",5,3
1st Review,"The product worked fine for couple of days and then started disconnecting as and when it likes! The device becomes discoverable only after a restart - quite painful experience, especially when it happens during a phone call. I've submitted a warranty claim - but only an exchange is offered, plus shipping to their Hyderabad office needs to be borne by us!

The build quality is flimsy and so is the sound output. Bass is okay - but sound is not very enjoyable, since sound staging is poor. Okay for calls and maybe audiobooks/movie.

For prospective buyers, hold on the original packaging and use the product extensively within the return
period - atleast it will save you the hassle of warranty claim and shipping charge!",2,3
you have been warned,"The sound quality and battery quality are fine. Occasionally the right side speaker was producing some noise but when I disconnect and reconnect it, the noise went away. The battery percentage it reports are completely wrong.

But after 20 days the left side speaker stopped working. I have emailed pTron to get a replacement product since this should be covered under warranty. Based on the experiences people have given about claiming warranty on pTron earphones, I have very little hope of getting a replacement product. Will update here about the experience.",2,3
Heavy to Wear & Average quality,After using 6 days my review product was good in bass and battery backup but the most important thing is very weak Bluetooth connectivity for the phone was so bad suddenly it disconnected and connect reconnected and if you are not using the Bluetooth and it was on standby then the Bluetooth was switch off and disconnected I have order 3 type of bluetooth from this company from 500 from 550 and from 800 but the quality and durability was so bad in all of them I suggest all of you that please purchase other company company,Helpful,3
"Don't buy it, if you are using on wifi","Bought it in competition with mivi and boat.the overall built quality is okish.the earbuds are metal not platic,so a plus point.coming to sound it is not for bass lovers.the basic sound is good but as indians are bass lovers,these earphones are not for them.All in all it is a good buy if you want to attend online classes and you want an extra budget earphones always paired with you laptop.if you are looking for music then they are ok type",One,3
Better go for Tangent EVO,"The microphone did not work for me with my laptop. It was working ok with my phone, but the microphone voice was a bit low. The device starts complaining about charging when there is about 30 % of charge within two hours of usage with full charge and it lasted around 2-3 hours. Just because the box in which it was delivered was destroyed accidently from my side, I was not able to return or replace the item. I also wrote to them through their site explaining the problems. No response yet I am not sure why it has so high rating, I have decided not to go for any Bluetooth headphones based on such a terrible experience! They say it has one-year warranty, but they don't even reply to my emails!",38,2
BATTERY: GOOD | SOUND/BASS: GOOD,"Seriously I never seen such worst product even street side product are far better.

1. First one I got defective unable to connect to call only songs were audible
2.Replaced product battery issue 70% battery drained immediately in 10 minutes time
3. U can hear opposite side person voice but they can hear only what they spoke",26,2
A good budget bluetooth device,But I and my friend bought this... We are seeing very low call volume when someone called i am not able to hear their voice clearly...,4,2
Okay on bluetooth connection but bad quality microphone,Bluetooth range is very short not even 5meters as opposed to 10meters. Boat Rockerz 255 Pro+ is much better than this.,2,2
Budget product,This product has a very poor quality. The Bluetooth is lost within a few meters. Anyone can guess the poor quality with quality of automated voice in the set. I am surprised that such a product is in the market and Amazon is selling it. I am sure even the most economical option the market might not last long but would offer a better quality. Extremely disappointing.,2,2
is waste of money i tell you why,"Very very worst sound quality it,s not good for gaming bass like local market product high bass is fully stop the foot steps in pubg

You can't reach their customer care person how much ever you try. You will be automatically cut after few minutes of wait. Your mails would bounce back second time and you won't get even an automated reply for your mails.

Simply feeling sick of the product company.

Better go for a product for which you have realistic support.",Helpful,2
Hate it!!!,"After one week of use the sound started bursting of earphone and call volume is so low , other person is hardly audible. Applied for warranty , ptron team is saying that it has to be dispatched just in 4 days from the date of mail to Hyderabad and customer has to bare charges, else warranty is not applicable.

Yet another Chinese Product that comes with Ride Your Luck Type Assurance,"'Tis foldable. 'Tis sturdy. 'Tis heavy.

Bad quality of sound..its just ok ok product," Holder is perfect! Some ppl say that it doesn’t stay and falls off, but it’s PHYSICS!! Weight balance nahi karoge to phone ya iPad gir jayega na!! CENTRE of gravity baahar chali jaye to balance nahi rahega! This stand works perfect for my iPad, iPhone and pixel phones! Even 12 pro max stayed perfectly balanced! The gap helps for the wire to pass and charge the phone while watching a movie!
Very handy for old age ppl. Good for bedside also! A little bit heavy but it’s made up of metal so weight was not avoidable, hence DURABLE and that’s the thing that helps to bare weight of the device!! Agar self defense me use bhi karna pade to chal sakta hai)) 👌👌👌",52,1
Poor Build Quality and stopped working intermittently within a month,"I have tried some other mobile stands, but all of them suffer from the same problem: you cannot keep the phone straight. The phone will be tilted at an angle. This is okay in most circumstances, but when doing video calls/recording, it would seems as though you are looking down on the other person.

This stand can keep the phone almost near vertically. If you change the angle too much then the phone will fall down or the stand will topple. You can also charge the phone while using the stand and it can even accommodate phones with thick cases.

The stand is really sturdy and I have no doubt it will last for a long time to come. However, it is expensive.",33,1
Left side stopped working after 20 days,"Here's the thing. I bought the same stand from Flipkart at INR 400. Same brand, same product, but no polish at all. Mildly rough to touch (hence easy to scratch), but very rigid and sturdy, as expected.
Next week I ordered the same item from Amazon for INR 312. Much better polish, and smooth to touch.

Both are made with Aluminum. Rigid, sturdy, good grip. Looks really good on a minimalistic desk. Differences were in price and polish. If I had not purchased the two from different websites, I wouldn't have known the quality difference!

@ELV, work on your quality control.

Nonetheless, great product!",31,1
connectivity was so bad most of the time it disconnected but it is irritating,"I haven't moved it since I bought it, however if you would keep changing the angles frequently it would be loose in no time. Try not to do that, from a desk item point of view, works great. Keep note that if you have braided cable your charger might not fit properly, since the elevation of bottom stand and the phone isn't enough at 90 degree angle, the charging wire would have to struggle to fit. Also you can't fit a headphone jack on a op6. So if this fits your use, then go ahead buy it.",20,1
Good as spare earphones.,"If you use Zoom to conduct or attend meetings from the phone, this device is excellent.

1. Your appearance on the call is stable and steady and is thus professional.
2. Your hand won't hurt if the call is long.
3. The height is good to plug the charging cable below.
4. The price is right
5. The quality is very good

Don't think twice.
Just buy this product.",21,1
This was a very disappointing purchase for me.,"Really love this because it is adjustable and can be used for multiple purposes like reading, video calls, viewing, etc. The pictures really don't do justice to this product. It looks so much better in person. It is sturdy and heavy and it does not look bulky at all. I'm planning to buy more for my family.",31,1
Waste of money don't buy it,"Great value for money. Excellent design and finish, Very sturdy so feels like it is made from steel. Folds flatter than a wallet so can be easily carried in the back pocket. Perfectly engineered hinges can be adjusted to hold the mobile or tablet at any angle from vertical to 180 degrees.

Bluetooth range is short,"Product is as per image and description. It's look is antique. ABS-Plastic-fibre materials are not durable, but, this product is durable. I think this is not Aluminium but wrought iron which is also light weight and costlier and delayed rusting type material.

Overall, I just loved the product, customer please don't make 2nd thought just buy it.",12,1
Very poor quality,This product is amazing and its totally a matel. Has space in bottem and back side to connect the cable. Perfect for Reading . Good and handy product only one bad thing little bit overpriced,126,5
It's very cheap but don't buy,"This product is strong, sturdy stable and will
last very long. No doubt about it. Looks more suitable for mobile phones than tablets. One major disadvantage is - most of the mobile phones have the speakers, mic at the bottom. So the hooks to hold the phone cover these and make it practically useless to make calls or watch videos in portrait mode. Think about your usage before purchasing this.",18,5
Worthless,"I'd have to say, if you are about organized spaces, professional look and reliable gadgets and accessories, this phone/laptop stand stands out from the crowd.

I like how flexible it is and yet stays in place at the angles you adjust the stand to, for your optimum eye-to-phone angle.

The material is pretty sturdy, light weight enough and yet strong enough to not stress about having to balance your phone so it does not fall.

The design keeps in mind various mobile phone charging points so makes it easy to keep the cable organized and easy to insert and remove.

The only reason I did not yet give 5-star is that I want to use it a few weeks and see how the movement and reliability works out.",19,5
Waste of money. Customer service not willing to serve,"It's the best mobile stand but overpriced, that's why reduced one star, otherwise it would have been a 5 star product.

I have purchased it twice, first time @299/- and second time @349/- and now I see it's price go up to 500/-. That's not fair. Price should not go beyond 349/- that's the max it could be worth.

It's super-useful, can be used with mobile and iPad easily. Very stable, never had an issue with imbalance and stability. And it has foldable parts so you can get whichever angle you want for your position to watch something on your mobile.

It even looks great, not a cheap-looking product. I even use it in my YouTube videos.

It's made of metal, so I guess will last long, although I will update this review after 6 months of usage.

Product life is questionable and no support available. It's only on paper.,"Made in India, metal mobile holder. It can withstand any smartphone and Tablet. It supports any screen types of mobile or iPad from 4-inch screens up to 12-inch screens. Hard metal and genuine product theoretically a good product, but build quality is poor the alignment of the metal pieces is slightly off, and the rubber guard pieces are badly stuck on, mostly misaligned. A fraction more care, and this could easily be a 5-star product. Other reviews also point to the same lack of refinement.",13,5
Third class ptron service,"The stand is sturdy...can easily hold any type of (Android or iOS) phone having upto 6.5"" of height and even more....and can be swiveled to a great degree too.

Phone may be placed horizontally or vertically...whichever way you prefer.

Ample space for allowing the charging wire to unobtrusively charge your phone from bottom (if reqd.), without affecting your viewing experience.

Preferably should be put on a solid surface (like a table) and not on a soft bed , etc....else, it may tilt due to the un-evenness and make your phone fall too.

The only reason why I gave it a 4/5 is because of the dull surface texture....which is very different from the shining & sparkling surface of the item shown in the pics here.

Decent purchase 👍",5,5
'Tis foldable. 'Tis sturdy. 'Tis heavy," So I have been using it continuously from the day of purchase. Till now no problem in handling the phone. But the pads provided under the product are not very strong in sticking to the surface. Also, we have to slow down our speed of finger movement as the things vibrates, I mean it shakes a little. But over all it is helping me. With proper angle one will get the comfort he/she wants.",6,5
A perfect holder,"Many have already mentioned its thickness, heaviness, sturdyness, durability. So i will skip on that part.

However, it is supposed to hold a 10.1 inch tablet/iPad without any issue as well, but it cant withstand tablet weight and since base is not broad enough, it is not stable...also its hinges close itself due to the weight of the tablet.
I bought for a tablet, but after seeing its limitations, i am using it for mobile phone, and it holds mobile perfectly.
No issues for mobile, but a bit unstable for a tablet.",4,5
A must buy if you want to keep your phone almost vertically upright,"As my hubby is an avid gadget-freak person he always choose resilient accessories and there’s a lot of factor, that goes into choosing the right and appropriate thing for a particular device for him and now for me also. Earlier we used to have those plastic phone stand which used to be tight in the beginning 3 to 4 months but later it always became droopy. So this time we ordered, ELV brand phone stand which has all manoeuvres which we conveniently needed. At first, we bought only two, but after put to use, we ordered more of different colour.

ABOUT THIS PRODUCT : This simple yet subtle multi-use foldable dock-mount has ingenious aluminium body, its super lightweight, easy to use with different angles and is a downright-match for your everyday gadgets. Its rightly suitable for your smart-phones, tablets or kindle of varied dimensions. These stands are satisfactorily robust and due to its robustness are better to use anywhere. What makes them special compared to others is they are designed with anti-slip pads.

I highly recommend this well-designed product to everyone since it made our job done with ease whether its to read, chat-time, face-time, Internet surfing or zoom-calls.

Different quality among sellers,"Excellent product, very sturdy, smooth joints to change position at the same time the joints are quite firm to hold in the position (doesn't slip). It is a multi position holder and gives you good convenience to position your mobile at different view angles. I like the product, as it is very convenient for my office and personal, hands free - video conferencing / calling. It is very comfortable to watch hands free - movies and videos. I would have given a 5 star rating, but for a small disappointment with the finish / texture of the holder. I was bit disappointed when I opened the package, with the image of display in my mind. In the web, the images displayed are glossy / shiny, whereas the holder I received was matte finish. The holder looks little dull. First impression was not a good impression. Product is technically wonderful, aesthetically disappointing. Seller / Amazon should change the picture in the advertisement.",3,5
Depends on how you use it.,"Theoretically a good product, but build quality is poor: the alignment of the metal pieces is slightly off, and the rubber guard pieces are badly stuck on, mostly misaligned. Pity, because it takes the same amount of effort getting it right, as it does doing it wrong, like this one. A fraction more care, and this could easily be a 5-star product. Other reviews also point to the same lack of refinement, so this is probably an endemic QC issue.",95,4
The product is good and sturdy,"It does the job. But:

1. Item is not finished properly. Too rough to touch. This can easily scratch and fray your large mouse pad if you move it here and there.

2. It wobbles. You need to be bit careful while using any 6.5 inch or longer screen phone kept on it; specially when you touch the upper quarter of the screen. (The base plate should have been wider and other two should have been longer by few centimetres.)

3. It's difficult to place phone vertically if you connect charger and 3.5mm headphone at the same time (headphone jack on bottom).

4. The soft pads won't last longer; it might detach.",57,4
Perfect little stand.,"The product built quality is good. The metal used makes it heavy and hence provides the necessary stability, however there is one flaw.

Since the design has a bottom support to hold the phone, phones which have speakers at the bottom, when kept in standing position, the voice is completely blocked if the speaker mode is enabled. I am using iPhone which has speakers at the bottom of the phone and hence if a call comes and I put it on speaker, the voice is completed muted.

Another thing that is just an observation is the grips at the bottom of the product needs to be of better quality. While they are in perfect condition, they look delicate and might come out pretty soon.",18,4
Excellent. Very sturdy. Folds flat to fit in back pocket.,"The stand is not able to support a tablet. But for a smartphone, there will be no problem. There is a risk of it getting toppled so one has to set it up rather carefully. I have a suspicion that after some time, the various hinge joints might become lose. Lets see how things turn out. One great feature of this stand is that you can charge your phone while it is placed upright on the stand. On the balance i would call it an average product.",11,4
ELV mobile stand,"I bought this for s6 lite tab. I was able place the tab with folded cover case on the stand easily. The problem is it's not the most stable stand. U have to take care of the angle otherwise the stand falls backwards. Also if u have to move the stand it's best to first take out the tablet from stand else your tab might fall from the stand bcz as i mentioned before the stand isn't extremely stable. As long as u are not moving stand here n there a lot it's a decent one fro this price i guess. Also the height of the stand is not much. N u can't change it. So if u sit for long hours on tab this might stress out your eyes n neck. I am using pile of books to raise the level and maybe i will stick a heavy rock/ paper weight or something on its flat surface to make it more stable so i can change its angle for better ergonomics (jugaad,lol). If u don't mind spending some extra money it's best to buy a stand where u can adjust height too. But if u can't isse kam chal sakta hai. :)",4,4
Just Order this item without any doubt,When mobile is kept on this stand it immediately rolls down. Further it doesn't hold mobile also. Mobile also falls down. How to take photo when the mobile itself is lying in fallen position. Fallen mobile can't take its own photo. You may try at your end and see it yourself.,3,4
Good and handy product,"The holder will start developing patches making it look very old and rusted out…tried cleaning it in vain

Secondly one very important technical aspect which the makers missed. While most of the phones have the speakers at the bottom, once you keep the phone in vertical position on the stand, the speakers get covered with thr bottom part of the stand making it difficult to have a hands free call unless someone uses headphone",One,4

Best stand ever,This adjustable one is kind of disappointing because the joints / hinges are getting loose quite easily. It doesn't hold its position when we adjust it and the phone fell over number of times. The fixed one is good because it doesn't have any joints. Not worth at this price point.,One,4
"Good Indian mobile holder, but could have been better"," This stand is not suitable for larger handhelds like tablets/ipads. These needs to be stuck to the table/surface

Sturdy Stand,"This is precisely the problem with Make in India. You make an excellent product overall and introduce a (deliberate? I'm looking at you planned obsolescence) weak point that makes the whole product a huge waste of money for the user whereas the seller laughs his way to the bank.

The material is solid and heavy. Feels good initially. The bottom hinge is so pathetic, that is gives way within a month just after the return window closes.

Does the job with few shortcomings,"After using for about a 9-10 days continuously, the hinge where the phone is supposed to kept got loose and lost its sturdiness. It does not hold up in a position I want and have to adjust a lot because of it. Also, the coating of the product is not proper.

Good build quality however with one flaw,"Rough aluminium finish. If you don’t have a mobile cover it will scratch your phone.

Not the best overall but if u are broke u can make this one work,"Edit : Downgrading rating from 3 star to 1 star due to easily detached rubber pad and strikingly lose Hinges even with sparing use. Not recommended.
Original review.
This is my second adjustable mobile stand. Got it for Rs 298.
Pros
Good value for money
Can house tablet

Cons
Hinges too lose
Not refined build quality (one side is about 2 mm higher see second picture where I compare it to other such product)
Rubber pads at bottom may come off easily
Can't use for writing on tablet with stylus as it rocks too much",147,2
Not suitable for the purpose thus can't comment on other aspects," Very unstable, bottom of the stand is very light weight easily slips off when u place a heavy weight mobile. Tried with 5.5 inch and 6.5 inch mobile but still my phone fell from the stand. Fully disappointed. Want refund after returning immediately.",2,2
Not worth it,"Material not Aluminum as promised, Finishing rough n crappy, quality crude & not as showcased, hinges will get loose very soon, easily detached rubber pads, worth Rs 200/- , MRP kept too high (4 times) to mislead buyers of its quality, Since no response on Mobile, spoken to manufacturer n supplier on land but no satisfactory reply from them. Not worth buying at this price, not recommended at all.",3,2
Product finish not good as in picture but it does it's job well,"For a cell phone holders like this, you really have to understand how to balance it. The basic thing is to add more weight to the base so that the cell phone weight won't make it fall back. You failed to understand this basic concept! On the contrary the base is the lighter part of the entire unit. For what have you designed this stand? Nokia 1100? These days the phones are bigger with bigger batteries, heavier (some weigh even 240 grams), and larger. To tolerate such weights, the stand must have a heavy base. This stand couldn't hold my Asus ROG 3. Not a good one for almost all phones that came this year and years to come.",4,2
Not that good, Completely a waste of money. Hinges have become use after use of a few days. And now it's useless. Spent 309rs on it but it has gone to dump now. Please issue me a refund because it's a useless product after few days. Please refund me the money asap. I would have remated it zero or 1/2 star if it was possible.,One,2

Not Ideal,"I received fastest delivery. However, after receiving the product, my whole enthusiasm was gone. It's pathetic finish in Matt, while in the product picture, it's shown as smooth finish. If I use it, my phone would get scratches on it, due to its rough finish. It looks like a duplicate item at this price, as it was supplied in a simple cardboard packing.

Hence, I returned it.",Helpful,2
Poor quality hinges,"Poor quality, in terms of color, finish and looks.
Its grey, instead of silver color.
Very poor finish.
Not fit for office table.

Maybe ok for bedside table.

Regarding sturdiness and durability I will tell later.",Helpful,2
"Quality reduced drastically, spoiled a nice product","Everything was good, except for the colour and polish of the stand. It seemed like the polish has been removed from many places and wherever that has happened, they have coloured it with black marker, thinking that the customer is a fool and he/she wouldn't notice. Returned it because of this reason, otherwise it was nice.",Helpful,2
Unpainted or unpolished surface,"No suitable for tablets. It bends down with the weight. Also, the hinges have developed almost a millimetre of play and have become loose.
Paint flaking off is another small issue.
The only thing good about this stand is that it doesn't topple backwards with weight.
Ahh, only if it could come with better hinges.",Helpful,2
Thread got loose and doesn't hold anymore,"I was looking for a mobile/tablet holder/stand for a long time in Amazon. I was going through a lot of other options which were bit costly arounf 500-650 bucks. But I don't want to spend that much amount for a simple stand. Then I found this which will do the same job and looks alike in half of the price. But I ahd doubt in my mind that wheather it will do the job or not?. Then I went ahead and bought one. Particularly about this stand. It's build quality is very good. It comes with alot options. It has mobile/tablet holder height increase/decrease option for ur convience. And u can adjust angle obviously u can see it images. Its good for watching movies and video calls.
The one con I would mention is it works on the sturdy floor. U can't keep it on ur mattress. It needs strong base support for transferring weight. The tablet it hold on particular angle u can't adjust like mobile phones. Because tablet weight are more than mobile phones. But still it does the job. U can't expect 360 degree support in 350bucks. Final verdict is good one in 350 rupees. Don't think too much if u r looking for a stand budget buy it.",30,1
Not suitable for long time use !!!,"I was looking for mobile stands for quite sometime and this one fits perfectly in my price range and expectation

The body is made of steel and is very sturdy to use.

The adjustable arm lends great angle for viewing can be closed completely and can be carried around in a bag easily

The space between the base is very thoughtful, so the device can be charged easily without any disturbance to the viewing angle

I have used both mobile phone and a tablet and both can be hold perfectly.",7,1
Wobbly Wobbly Woosh,"I have bought many mobile stands in the past, but nothing gave me the confidence to keep my phone on the stand like this one. Wirh a strong base that firmly grips the table surface you can rest assured that your phone is going to remain steady. Also the flexibility of height adjustment is great! I can even charge my phone or use the earphone jack while keeping on the stand which other stands don't allow. If I were to pick a flaw is that there is no button mechanism to change height. It is abruptly yanked up or pushed down. I hope it won't spoil after some time.",7,1
Sturdiness & coating,"The base is a little heavy, which makes it sturdy in all positions possible. The holder bar is extensible too, and it doesn't occupy a lot of space when folded. The rubber grip both on the face side and at bottom is good. Value for your money. Though probably chinese made, but a good product indeed.",3,1
Unpolished Aluminium - too expensive.,"Excellent, simple to use mobile / tablet stand, very nice aesthetics and appearance, matte finish white with chrome studs, good inclination, rubbery boot to make the stand sturdy, rubber lining to hold the mobile in place. Overall a great product. At 99 INR it is a must to have steal deal!",4,1
It’s an IRON product,"Good built.
My phone weight is 192gm and with case it is 230gm plus. This handles my phone without any problem.
Please note , if you increase the height of the stand and then put the mobile, then it won't carry because it is not that heavy to hold and I feel that is fine because it is only a mobile stand.
I am happy with my purchase and recommend it.",4,1
"Poor built quality, Hinges may loosen with sparing use","The clips at the bottom work perfectly when the phone is in slanting, however the phone becomes unstable when the phone is kept perpendicular to the ground. The swivel of the phone allows the phone be kept perpendicular to the ground, therefore making the grip better willake the phone more usable.

However, the product is excellent and strongly recommended.",3,1
Disappointed..not an ideal stand,"HIGHLY RCOMMENDED
Sturdy material
Good joints
Been using it daily for 2-3 months and the joints are still as tight as it was on day one.
The extendable vertical arm helps in adjusting the height as per your needs.
The slot for charging port on the bottom of the holder is very much appreciated.",One,1

Good for stability and keeping phone in front of your eyes. Read review for more details,"Its really a nice stand and seems to be sturdy as well.

But some cons I found

It would be grate if we can rotate the head as well so that we can keep the phone in landscape mode as well.

Also it would be nice if there is some mechanisms or straps which attaches the phone in to the dock rather than just placing on it. Now if the table shakes the phone has a tendency to fall. I am using a rubber band to fix that issue.",Helpful,5

Just the stand I wanted,Height adjustment is very less. Bit more height adjustment will be better. But it does its job. Good product,2,5
Very handy mobile / tablet stand!,Price so high . The stand is five inch height.It may extend to 7.5 inch. Bad- Floor stand very light. Weight must be increased. Side weidth only 2.5 inch. Not in a good position to keep the mobile. Material is good. At last I dislike it. Stand of Rs.500/- which I purchased rather good to use. I have kept a vimbar of 145 gms to maintain the balance.,7,4
Good purchase,"I primarily needed this to hold my live sessions rather than keeping my phone on a book. Its just a stand and the best alternative is to keep the phone on the table. Not much excited with this stand, a bit on the pricy range of 1000 bucks. If I see this in a shop, I would never pick this up, but thanks to Amazon, a product like this still has a market of first trials.",3,4
"Good product overall, recommended!","Worst quality, must have been used, the outer box was completely torn. Had scratch marks all over, was dusty. The major problem was with the product itself. The right side wing is lower than the left and when the mobile is placed, it slants. The slant is too visible and watching the mobile in that position is too uncomfortable. Yes for the price did not expect too much but at least should have been a bit ok.
Got a replacement, the replaced model was better than the previous one. Not great but ok for the price.",Helpful,4
HIGHLY RCOMMENDED!!! Must buy for home or office phone usage, It can't hold a tablet..Not good for the tablets but if you want it for the mobile then go fr it without thinking twice .. i have been using this from the past few months for my mobile and it is working fine but it's a big NO NO for the tablets,One,4
Best mobile phone holder,It's definitely not a Striff. Doesn't have any branding. The packaging is also of a low end Chinese product. But looks sturdy and will be able to do the job. If you are not too concerned about the brand and only looking for something minimalistic which is fit for the purpose of holding mobile and tablets. This is the right product. It also has an advantage of a cut out which helps you to charge or see video/ movies while its on the stand. Not a lot of products offer this. 3* is only because it lacks the branding which is equally important,Helpful,4
Excellent product. Would recommend to buy,Too light weight and slippery after having grip tgen also. If I'm keeping smartphone on it and touching on screen then it's easily movable or smartphone can fall down also for 6.5inch smartphone its small and stability is not that good when you are touching the smartphone on screen for usage.,Helpful,4
Happy with my purchase ☺️,This product is nothing great but just ok. It caters to the requirements of a mobile stand especially during online classes for students these days. The stand is not sturdy enough as it tends to fall forward due to the weight of the mobile and therefore one has to adjust the position balancing the weight.,Helpful,4
Short review,"It is not as promised. Particularly the elevation of the upper part. It is not coming up beyond 3.05 Centimetres. For cost cautious, better find cheap Alternatives. In the market we can find them @ Rs.10/- also. I am using them. They don't lack any comfort to the user.",Helpful,4
Great product,"product is broken within a month but you can use it with ""JUGAD"". it is very stylish and easy to store and use. the concept is very nice but durability is not good.",Helpful,4
Nice product 👍,Chances to fall offs are high since there is no clip to fasten the device. iPhone 11 is falling off if I tilt the arm.,Helpful,4
Good To Use,Base to hold the phone is small that it often falls from the stand. One of the base is loose and does not go inysnc with other base. The height could be more. Sturdy is fine.,85,3
Quite good,"not designed well, not easy to fold it back. springs that hold the weight of phone are not sturdy, the received item had one of them defected so returned it",24,3
Worth buying,"This product is suitable for only less weight phones, for iPhone, Samsung and oppo phones are weight is high, so when I kept these phones on the stand, the stand is not wieighing for these phones",3,3

Waste of money. Find Cheap Amazon Delivery Service is Good.,"Unstable. Shaking. On each touch on the phone, it seems that the phone and stand will fall together.

So far so good," The built quality is good. All the features in the watch are approximately working well. The strap is removable and can be changed. I've got the golden color variant. But in the image shown in the info is slightly different. It's is not golden but slightly to rose with gold(which looks attrractive to be true). The brightness level is also decent in outdoors. The incoming messages and calls are also visible without any lag. The screen is not lagging while using the interface. It's working perfect. For this price range you can obviously go for it.
Point to be noted: while I got the watch, when I long pressed the watch button my watch wasn't turning on. But nothing to worry ,once you charge to full and turn it on, it's working perfectly.",134,5
Good,"It's 1st day I just unboxed the product. Looks good, features are good. As a first time user had some initial difficulties in understanding to start the product but later its fine. User manual instructions could be improved a little. There is no time adjustment option which seems to be issue for me as I keep my watch 5 minutes faster than normal time. Also the max lock time is 20sec. This could be increased upto 60 sec.

build quality and screen excellent 👏🤗,"Pros

- Stylish watch
- It has all the required parameters that are necessary to monitor your health during this pandemic

Cons

- Firebolt lures customers to give good feedback with promise of extra warranty period and other offers. While I brought this watch looking at the customer feedback on amazon, I now realize that most of them were not honest. A good brand would not use such practices if they trust their product.
- Mobile app UI requires a huge improvement
- Battery life is not upto the mark. with all power saving mode on I have to recharge in 4 days time
- I don't think the steps counter is working well, does not capture all my steps

I hope manufacturer will fix all these issues in the next firmware update. However overall this might be the best available at the given price point.",75,4
Value for money!,"I have received this watch today. Overall look and performance are very good. Value for maney product.

Edit 1:
This is my review after 1+ month usage.
It is a mixed experience.
I compared the activity with realme watch and Adidas Running app which uses GPS for distance calculation.
When I compared, I can see Realme watch is giving accurate details. But this watch is lagging a KM when we walk for 6 KM.
You can check my screenshots attached.
Another interesting thing is even duration also lagging which I felt very strange here.
But one good thing is this watch does not need a specific bluetooth connection. It will allow another device to connect along with this. And another good thing is it will update the app in real time unlike in Realme Watch. In Realme watch you need to refresh everytime to get the details updated in mobile app.
These are the pros and cons I have observed. I hope product team finds my review, will fix these issues and provide a firmware update.
There are no options to provide feedback in app",59,4
Smart and elegant smartwatch in affordable price.," Made my review after a week. Moderate product for this price range. Battery withstand only 3 full days with max usage. Bluetooth connectivity is worst. Doubt it would even connect within 5 meters as well. Would be nice if there was more watch faces.
SPO2 reading : Not sure if its accurate.
BPM : Not sure if its accurate
BP : Total Dump the readings are totally wrong when compared with a medical BP unit and it always shows a constant reading to anyone who uses it. Blood Pressure reading is total crap.",56,4
AWESOME PRODUCT AT THIS PRICE RANGE..!!,"Step count accuracy is quite low. Body movements during sleep is getting counted as step count. While going to bed it was around 200, while getting up in morning 535..! That shows, I had walked 335 steps during sleeping condition, that's not possible.
Battery is getting drained faster. In 2 days 49% drained, that's quite fast.
Value for money is not too good, not too bad considering availability of blood oxygen and BP measurements in this cost.

Although the product is waterproof, still even a droplet of water brings random faster auto-manoeuvrability in the product screen..",14,4

Nice Smart watch,"I have been using this watch for more than 2 weeks & on an overall view this is a good one to buy.

Pros: Design, material, quality, features are really good and worth for the money you give. Especially the round dial I liked and that was the main reason I bought this one.

Cons: Charge in the watch is not lasting for 8 days and all as they say, it is hardly lasting for 2 days, max of 3. If you dont use the vibration and dim the contrast. Watch faces are really a draw back, we have very limited ones even in the Da Fit app and cannot download anything more apart from the ones in that app. This feature is even wide in other local brands but this one was disappointing. If this could be upgrated in the next version it would be really good.",One,4

Notification works fine.
Display is very poor.

2 stars and not returning only for various screen designs and that it tells correct time :-)",4,3
Good choice for each peny spent.,"I ordered this one after reading positive reviews on Internet. Amazon did great job of one day delivery with proper packaging. The watch is good as digital watch with brilliant Colors and display. But it’s not smartwatch at all. Problems I faced consistently
1. Touch is not as responsive as even simple low cost smart watches. Need to press particular icon 2/3 times.
2. SPO2 sensor - always flipping between 96/97 no matter whatever you do.
3. Heart rate- always better 76-79 with even running state, it never increased beyond 85. The devices is not defective as sensors are active throughout test.
4. BP - horrible. Always between 138-135 /87-88.
I tested it in morning, midnight, during exercise, no changes. Even with different people, reading are same.
5. Steps are increasing with multiple count at a time.

If you’ve looking for purely health tracking purpose, this is useless devices. Branded band will be better purchase over this crap. It’s only showoff. I don’t compare this with Fitbit/Garmin watches neither expect health vitals accurate as medical equipment’s but they should be in range and responsive to body state.

Message to Fire Boltt - Better make good product rather asking all customers to put product review compulsory for registering warranty.",3,3
You can go for this," There is an issue with the upgraded software. Everything was working fine. Suddenly the software needed an update and issues started. It is observed that the watch doesn't sync with phone 99% of the time. It keeps getting disconnected and then shows connecting for some time, after which it might connect for 5 seconds and then disconnect again. Please fix the bug 🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞. This is like any normal watch if it doesn't sync with the cell phonephone & stay connected. Have uploaded video. I have uninstalled and installed the software few times, that doesn't fox the issue.

Second issue, battery backup is not as good as other smartwatch. Expected this to be better. Tried different watch faces to see if that helps, didn't see any significant difference. Takes alot of time to charge, once charged last for 4 days max.",3,3
Value for Money,"Excellent featured product within this price range but after sales service is pathetic...I have given 2stars because of the pathetic after sales service... suddenly the side button of the watch isn't working and I have complained to their customer care 5days before but still they are saying that it will take more 10-15 days for any resolution... although they have no area wise local service centres, they are giving support through online only and the online service is just pathetic, even customer care person's behaviour isn't so polite...
If this type of after sales service they will continue, this company will not exists in market in very long time...",3,3
Good but not the best,"Pros
Good looks
Accurate time 😜
Weather check

Cons
Company gives 3 months warranty after you add five stars on Amazon
Bp, spo2 and heart rate are all fake . Even my table shows bp and spo2 level
Google fit does not work
Da fit app is worst and needs a lot improvement
Even my MI band is better in terms of tracking",3,3
Honest Review,"Worst watch i had ever seen, not measuring heart rate continuously, limited watch faces, not accurately measure HR, BP, SPO2.
TOTALLY WASTE OF MONEY",3,3
Value for money product but some cons are there,"Its just a watch with touch screen display all other features like notification,steps,sports modes is not accurate and the button is dead after 1 week . The box comes with gaana and other subscription you have to give 5 star review on amazon to get that subscription on mail now i know why there are many good reviews for this watch. The notification didn't work if your phone is in pocket you need to keep the phone closer to get notifications on watch wich is useless. And the steps tracking is the funny thing i just wake and just gone to kitchen and when i look at the watch it showing 720 steps even if i adjust everything on the watch the steps tracking not working well. The spo2 is working well i think. But heart rate is different . Go for mi band if you are looking for accurate data. This is just a watch . Its worth if the price is between 1500-2000",4,3
Not as expected,After a lot of search and thoughts finally i bought this smart watch. My reason for buying a smart watch was changeable watch faces. The company claims that there are 100s of cloud based watch faces. But it is false there are only 73 watch faces including the pre loaded ones. Of them majority of the faces are not good. Only a handful of them are good ones. I wouldn't suggest this watch to anybody. Battery is also disappointing. Only 3 days of battery backup even without using all time heart rate monitor or bp monitor. Accuracy of the meters are not dependable. Even the company disclaims it. So it is just a show piece.,Helpful,3
Good product but further improvement desired,The numbers written on the metal dial on the watch and on the picture on the box are in opposite direction. The number 30 is given on the opposite direction in the metal band. This raises the question that is the company spending on branding and not looking into basics. The touch screen is not sensitive enough. I think instead of focusing on features basics should have been improved.,Helpful,3
Loaded Budget watch but failed in screen quality.," I don't know how these other people who are reviewing this are giving it 5 stars. It deserves negative reviews if possible. The tracking features are a lie. I work night shifts, and am not usually wearing the watch while working so I was surprised to see it had tracked 3 hours worth of sleep. Then on a whim I tried to check for its other features and was surprised to see that it was actually measuring oxygen levels and heart beat for my mattress. Now either my mattress has a life, that breathes and has a heart or the watch's feature are not accurate at all. Even with the step count. If you stand at one place and just swing your arms up and down, it would count them as steps. Now, coming to watch faces. The app has about 70 watch faces to choose from which are mostly all variations of one another. The watch however has 6 spots for watch faces and 5 are already occupied and you can't replace them, so you can only download one new watch face from the app at a time. Also the app doesn't remember downloaded watch faces so everytime you will have to download the watch face again. All in all, it is not worth the money you are spending for it at all.

So unless you want a fancy piece of watch that is just good enough for having on your wrist, DO NOT BUY this.",7,2
Decent, Watch is totally fake with false reading s it shows pre fixed reading s. I tested with some doubt with placing it over book...my book also had Bp and pulse and spO2 within normal range. Check my video,8,2
IDK BUT ITS GOOD FOR SHOW OFF," Worst thing to buy, THEY DON'T HAVE RETURN POLICY, this watch don't even have a find my phone function which is basic necessity sensors are fake and faulty, don't be a fool like me they don't even have there own application for the watch if you want to spend your 3500rs spend on poor and needy people atleast they can GIVE BLESSINGS IN RETURN.",5,2

Unsurprisingly, the pathetic company does not even confirm the warranty.

Bad product,"I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.
My priorities were like this -

1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)
2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.
3. Decent battery backup.
4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.

And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -

1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.
2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.
3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).
4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).

Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -

1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.
2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.
3. Select Feat. JBL E1+
4. Open Preset options
5. Select Blues and Voila!! 🎯

For other phones -

I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.

Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.

Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! 🙂

Happy Listening! 🎶",60,1
Waste of money its just a watch with touch screen display,"* It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.
* Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.
Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.
Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive
* The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.
* I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.
* While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.

**** Battery🔋 review (after 2 weeks)
Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.
I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .
I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.
And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6½ hrs.
Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.
The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.

****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT.",48,1
Disappointed.,"If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.

Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.

This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.

Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!

The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.

The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.
Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.
The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.

Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.

I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.
Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.

Battery Life: 4/5

Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.

Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.

Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.

Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.

Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.

And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :)

Note: I am now 7 months into using this. The earphones still work with the same quality as received. However, there's a little glitch. Whenever the battery percentage drops by 10 or 20 per cent, it seems to disconnect. It reconnects automatically, but it can get annoying. Doesn't happen every time, but there's a frequency. Tried calling on these earphones as well. Good quality. Earphones run for at least 3.5 hours and a single battery charge for the case gives at least 3-4 charges. So, all in all, good.",24,1
Low on commitment,"FIRST OF ALL THESE AIRDOPES ARE REALLY DOPE .. I HAVE BEEN USING THEM SINCE ONE MONTH AND HERE ARE MY HONEST REVIEWS ABOUT THEM IN SHORT..

DO NOT BUY,"The product is great in terms of build quality,sound and noise cancellation.Even the touch response is excellent so you don't have to pull your smartphone each time to change a song.About the battery it's pretty much good as it last for about 3-4 hours of continuous usage.The major feature is the bluetooth connectivity where you need not wait for pairing each time ,once BT switched on it automatically connects.!!!Just order without any hesitation and you will realise the value for money of this product",20,1
Watch is fake...readings are automatic,"Really amazing . Sound effects is really amazing .

1. Good and excellent sound quality with very good bass effect .
2. Amazing battery backup . First time i saw a ear buds with such a massive battery backup.
3. Very light weight , that not mean it may come out of ears . It was well fit and it wont fall out . Really gets a Perfect fit into ears . Since it is very light weight we can easily listen to music or movie for long hours no pain at all .
4. Connectivity . Omg i was quiet amazed with the connectivity , First time i can see a ear buds connect soo quick and easy . Pairing is very simple and fast . It has an option , when we took out the ear buds its automatically connects to the previously connected device and it works great .

Blindly go for it . U wont regreat.

Negative : wont find much .",19,1
Worst worst product with false reading.,"Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look. Initially I was too confused in chosing earbud. From xiomi to crossbeats to sony, I planned for everything. Unfortunately all had negative n positive reviews. So went for a fresh product and writing the review after 1 hr of use.

Sound n music quality is good. Built is premium. 2600 mah case, type C charging is best. Ipx7 is added in pro.

I bought it for calling purpose and I tested indoor n no one could differentiate that I was calling from earbud. So thumbs up.

Hopefully in long run the review holds true!",18,1
अति साधारण,"Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.

So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.

Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.

I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks.",14,1
," Thanks for coming to check my review, I purchased this product in Oct 2020 and now it's been a year and today's date is 28 Oct 2021 and yet it is working very smooth so I can't stop my self by writing this review, above photos and video is recorded just before putting this review, products sound quality, noise cancellation, bass quality, battery backup is best than expectations. eardrops case is very small and light weighted so you can carry it anywhere and anytime in your pocket. it has long lasting battery backup so you can enjoy your journey in better way, according to my use (ie. 1 movie every day, game for almost half and hour, YouTube videos anytime, and some time songs) after fully charging my eardrops I can use it for almost 3 days without charging. Earbuds takes 15-20 min for charging in case and case takes almost 1 hour to get fully charged.
Product look is very cute and stylish, also the silicon earplugs and silicon side plugs (see the video) gives better support to fit it in ear.
If you are planning to buy this product just don't think more, go and order it for you. Its really worth it to buy.",1787,5

"Inaccurate information for heart rate, BP monitor.",I had literally tried 5 Bluetooth earbuds before buying it and finally my search ends here. I am a deep bass lover and it has not disappointed me at all. Call quality is not good. If u want to buy it for frequent calls don't go for it. But if u can compromise on calling it is the best earbud....beleive me i had bought earbuds upto 5k....it is best in all of them!!,120,5
Don't buy. Spo2 98% accurate. Over cost," I enjoy listening music like you. I prefer quality in the music. Few facts prioritise this product than others.

1) This fits very well into the ears. They don't just drop off even during workouts, running. Since I'm a sports enthusiast I am able to say this.

2) Coming to the quality of Sound. I would say they aren't the best. I'm sorry but thats true. I have OnePlus buds whose music quality is much better than airdopes. But OnePlus buds won't fit well. There will be chances of loosing them.

3) Call quality is absolutely good when compared to many other brands of same price range in TWS category.

4) These Dopes are best for sports enthusiasts who loves hard bass. If you are one then you would love them. More over they look absolutely cool when you wear them.

Lime green, Red and Black are the best colors amongst the color options available.",50,5
Pathetic quality and forces customers to write revie to register for warranty,"So this was my first TWS purchase here are the pros & cons if you are thinking to buy it:

Pros:
-Pubg on the first day faced a negligible lag but after that is working completely fine.
-Bass is super excellent.
-Battery backup is also good & reliable.
-Easy on hand experience.
-Too smooth connectivity.
-Very much comfortable in ear and will not fall in any circumstances.
-While wearing handkerchief or a mask still other person is able to hear you completely on the call.
-Calling is very smooth and effective.
-Great touch technology used just read the guide to understand it properly.

Cons:
-Noise cancelation doesnot properly works while riding.
-On the calls have to speak up a bit loud sometimes while in a crowd.

Its a great purchase in this range in love with this one worth for such a low price.",30,5

2. Found difference in music quality while playing music and videos. For videos sound quality is litttle bit down.
3. Calling is only good in our home or calm places. Calling is difficult in crowded place or while bike rides or places with surrounding noises. Because the person towhom we are talking can hear surrounding noises.",12,5
Must buy if you are a basshead,"I bought musili vv1 for 1999 prior to buying this. It's louder compared to this. But lacks in quality of sound. So i returned muzili vv1 and ordered this one. It's my 6th boat headset over the years and yes boat delivers quality.
These airdopes are a bit of trouble if worn for over 45 mins. As many users have complained about and uneasy headache, I too faced it and had to remove it often. The headphones are not loud enough as one would expect them to be. So i tweaked my dolby atmos and max'd all the Equalizers to get the desired sound and yet it lacked somewhere. However the clarity, highs and lows and deep bass are great. It took roughly 3 hrs on full volume to deplete the battery to 50 %.

Worth every penny,In the picture it shows the boat symbol on airdopes but On my airdopes it is written boat I don’t have an idea about it. The photo doesn’t relate the product. This is an illegal offence of cheating.,127,4
"Really super . Good bass and sound quality , very light weight and perfect fit in ears","1st thing is 1st.
Amazon and the seller could have mentioned easily mentioned that it's made in china and complied with govt. Guidelines but they didn't.
It says Made in P.R.C. that's ""People's Republic of China""
I feel cheated, because if I would have know I wouldn't have bought it. Boat being a Indian brand, is manufacturing from China.

The product is just ok. Not bad.

(I am assuming Amazon will not put this review, let's see)",22,4
First buy review,"The earphones are good. Only problems are that it pains after one hour of use. Can't hear outside noise. Noise cancellation is not good. Capacitive button is cuts call and plays and pauses music while handling. Buttons are much better. Too much disco lights.
Rest everything is good.",14,4
Awesome earbuds,"The good:
+ Connection is alright
+ Build quality
+ Touch controls
+ Sound quality is also not bad
+ Battery life
+ Battery bank feature and type c charging are very welcome

The bad:
- THERE IS A CONSTANT STATIC IN THE LEFT EARBUD, its not noticeable when anything is playing but as soon as you pause audio its right there. Tolerable, but annoying.
- Too big for small ear
- Design makes it so the wings can irritate the inside of your ears if you're moving around.
- Way too much bass, balanced sound is out of the window.",15,4
Best eardrops I ever had.,"The boAt Airdopes 441 Pro are nic , with good build quality. The Audio and Call quality is Good.
But could hear a rattling sound in left earbud sometime . Some other people have also reported the same.",12,4
Good,"Sound quality is okay okay.
Left ear bud had a low hissing Sound whenever there is a bluetooth transmission happening like when starting a music, pausing, while listening also we can hear lot hissing in background when any music has in low tone.
Comfort wise it's good, touch sensitivity is also good.",14,4
Good...,"Received brand new product but one Airdope was stoped woking suddenly. After reading user manual, I came to know that, I need to put that airdope in charging case. Then only it will work properly. But it happens frequently. Also base quality is not that much good as expected. Hence returned this product. Thanks Amazon for refund my money as usual on time. (Which takes time from Flipkart.)",11,4
My first dopes 👌,"Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go. Magnetic box is efficient for securing the earbuds. LED indicator is functioning properly.
Cons: Brace yourself-
Bluetooth connectivity lost arbitrarily in between music. Call quality is not upto the mark- sound is poor despite adjusting call volume, initial and end parts of a call are lost with almost no noise cancellation. No gesture or facility for volume control. With no buttons and only touch maneouvred gestures it is very difficult to adapt to listening music or calling for long hours. Gesture are congested and not user-friendly.
Overall I would like to rate this a 3/5 for a budget bluetooth earphone.",8,4
For deep bass lovers a perfect earbud,"These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:
1: Budget
2: decent sound
3: Good Bass
4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)
5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.

If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 🌟 rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.

These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.

When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.

For me this was a major low unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars.",187,3
Honest Review,This is the second time I am writing this review. Not sure why my earlier detailed review which was more like a ownership review was deleted by Amazon. Hope this review is published and not eventually deleted however this review would not be as detailed as the previous one. Purchased this product in Aug 2020 and since then had 3 replacements from Boat within a year. Each unit would last 3 to 4 months max depending upon the usage and always one or the other earpiece would die out. The left earpiece of the 3rd replacement died out 2 days back. Please note I have mostly used them during my morning jogging/running. Over all the sound quality is good and enjoy them as long as they last but the overall durability of the device is very very poor. Attaching the 3 earpiece chargers as a proof.,120,3
Simply worth a single penny in this range.,"The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive. Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears.",43,3
Made in China market by Indian Brand Boat,"I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..
But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.
I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.

EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441. Also, the sound quality is best. But this noise has made me dislike the product. Sorry. Returning it.",33,3
Good quality earbuds,"Boat airdopes 441 pro model is having an issue in left earbud i.e. static noise issue ,I had this problem with my set so I returned it later I came to know that this problem is there for many others who brought this product,it is better if they solve the issue and re release the product,over all quality is excellent and the features are awesome,if anyone brought this and having same problem just return it because at first static noise is very low but in future gradually it will increase and irritate ,my previous earbuds of other company had same problem and I thought nothing will happen with that small noise later gradually it started to increase and it is irritating.",25,3
Some of pros and cons I found❣️,"Ordrd 441 Pro
Received in one day only Amazon delvry at best
But but retrurnd the headphn the next day
Call clarity v good
Battry good
Built quality specially rubber thing average
Now main use Audio Latency which is not acceptable for me.. YouTube videos almost impossible to c it was so bad
I am surprised not one reviw has ths complaint
So my particular piece was bad i dont knw as i opted for replacement only but thy refunded instead",20,3
Made in China now matters a lot,"When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2999 and within days - it was priced at 2499.
If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.
Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.
Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. This was my first ever purchase with boAt I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.
Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 1499.",15,3
Built quality not as expected,"So I bought this product from Amazon, honestly it was a bang for the buck. Nice fidelity, bass, comfortable and not so expensive. All was good for a month and then one side stopped working, so I reached out to boat and they asked me to ship the product and they confirmed they received it. They abruptly cut all the ties with me after that, they dont respond to my emails asking status, no response on twitter, helpline not going through. The ticket number is 1540334 and they didnt respond to me for the past 1 month. Stay away from any Boat product, rather than that go for some brand who will respond to you or buy a cheap one and toss it of when stops working.
Update: oct 25th. Finally they sent a replacemet earbuds. So changing the ratimg from 1 to 2.",11,3
Wrong information,"Pros :
1. Look
2. Case Quality
3. Bass
4. Bluetooth connectivity

Cons :
1. Very Low sound - in order to listen properly you have to keep the volume at 70% which is unlike Boat 311 V2.",13,3
It's Made in China. And they obviously don't want to tell you.,"Pros:

1) nice fit.
2) bass is adequate.
3) Sturdy build

Cons:
1) the auto-connect doesn’t worked for my device, ideally it should connect automatically to the last paired device.
2) the charging time is quite high.
3) the vocals and mids are not balanced, this device is more bass oriented.
4) the loudness could have been slightly better.
5) Missing Equaliser mode.
6) touch is bit clumsy and delayed, response time should have been better.

Verdict: the top 2 cons could be manufacturing defects, i have requested a replacement. This is a sturdy device in my understanding at the given price, but definitely there is big scope of Improvement.",5,3
Good but has problems,"If you are looking for true bass, then I would not recommend this. While it is good and high on music, it isn't as thumping as mentioned. One of the buds not working is a common problem and restarting/rebooting is the only option to fix it. Fixes perfectly with the ear and ears don't pain even after couple of hours of usage. It does work for 3.5 hours non-stop. No issues with calling.

Biggest Drawback: They work pathetically bad with laptops. Right from connectivity to touch sensors to music shuffling (especially on YouTube, everything lags at regular intervals. Bottom line is they are just not made for laptops but if you still want to use it then be prepared to use your hands on keyboard and delayed sound.",1197,2
its pretty good,"its a good set of ear buds but
1. the quality of sound gets bad when connected with macbook
2. due to absence of dual mic noise cancellation, it becomes very difficult to use it during a call as the other person hears lot of envt. noise

inability to use it during the call is the one big major disadvantage for this pair but other features are good like instant connection with mobile etc",337,2
Left earbud is rettling sound,I received the product with some defect. The left side of the airdops was making unwanted sound which is irritating after each and every small input.,305,2
Hissing Sound on earbuds,"Boat AirDopes, have by far been the most champion looking TWS that I have invested in. However, it makes me feel that the premium looks are simply to deceive the customers from other core issues that thus TWS has.

1. Connectivity: The connectivity is very poor and there is a lag between the video and audio.

2. Battery: The right earphones, just don't charge. So, I have been using just one TWS since about 2-3 months.

3. Warranty: There is no warranty on the product, and team boat never ever replies. It's absolutely impossible to get in touch with them. They are almost invisible. The aftersale services have been the worst. Actually, non existent.

4. Amazon: This is the 4th review that I am writing. Amazon has been consistently deleting my reviews.",61,2
Not expected from most awaited product.,Worst product plz don't buy it you will regret buying it for sure. My left ear bud not working just brought it previous month.,11,2
Good for a budget earphone,"Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.

I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.

Pros:
1. Great Sound Quality
2. Great Bass
3. Great Battery Life
4. Fast Charging

Cons:
1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.
2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.
3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.
4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.
5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.
6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.
7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.
8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.

So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.
You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.
boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.",9,2
Touch controls extra sensitive not useful when sleeping on the side,"Honest review after replacing the first assuming may be received a faulty product, the second was even worst. 1st the call quality was terrible absolutely no clear voice. No bass at all. So did a replacement the second had the same problem. Second one the left ear bud had stopped working. Did a reset still no use.",5,2
Enjoy while it lasts,defective left ear piece. Cracking sound on standby. Right side was ok. Very bad service from amazon. Left me with a loss of 500 rs after refund. I wanted a replacement but amzon denied the option as stock is limited. Never going to use amazon again.,6,2
Below average,"From the first look, they really looked very nice. I bought the red colour, and the red colour pops-up really nice.

They Charging Case is also very nice looking.

I wore them for a few minutes, and my ears started hurting.

The fitting is going to be different for each user, depending on the size of their years and their comfort.

Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass.

For people who would like to use it for official or personal calls, will feel that you will Sound robotic to the other person.

There is also a delay in voice-over, which I think it’s not that bad.

The noise cancellation is not there at all.

These are much better than a few of similar products available in the market. However, it will be to each user to choose these based on their comfort level as well as their pocket.",5,2
There is a PROBLEM with earbuds!! REPLACEMENT also has same.,I am really having such a bad experience using this Boat Airdopes 441 product. I ordered it on 10th June 2020. It's 28th and my left ear buds gets discharge in less than 10 minutes. I tried everything possible to cure the problem. I am not able to even factory reset it. The seller has closed the window of return. It's my third Boat's product but I am having really tough time with this third one. I don't know what to do. Product is under 1 year warranty but does it worth having a product which cannot even work properly for 15-20 days.,4,2
STATIC NOISE ISSUE,"I am really disappointed with boat airdrop441, really it's not more than 5 days I brought it ! And one of the airbud are not working properly and sound is not clear 😡😠 and it's really irritating me & making a buzz sound..... This is really horrible experience I had!!!!",876,1

This is the best product in this price range. #madeinindia",553,1

Almost worth the price,"If you're looking for the best Noise smartwatch under 2500, then you should go for Noise caliber. It has better display and has temp sensor.
But Noise caliber is kinda big and makes the screen look too small.

You should go for Noise ColorFit Grand if you want a normal sized watch. And there is no much of a difference between these watches any way.
___________________________________________________________
Screen: The screen is pretty good in this watch. The outdoor visibility is fine and it has a really good color reproduction. The touch response is really good comparing to other smartwatches at this price point.

Performance: This watch performs really well there is no kind of lag while using this device.

Health Tracking: I would say it is fine comparing the price. It is only 2500. There is Heart Rate monitoring, there is no Blood Pressure monitoring but there is SpO2 monitoring provided, Stress monitoring, sleep tracking,60+ workout modes.

Heart Rate Monitoring: Works fine 8/10 accuracy compared to a medical equipment. It is fast and can easily show the result
Spo2: I would say the most accurate feature in this watch. 9.5/10 accuracy
Stress monitoring: It gives a pretty accurate results. it basically shows your stress level
Sleep tracking; i haven't use it yet so, i cant tell
Work Out modes: It work! that's all i can say. in a good way though. It just helps you to organise your sport records. For example:- if you playing badminton and you select badminton in Work out mode, it tracks your calories, Max Heart beat, Average Heart Beat, Min Heart beat, Calories burned and workout time.
If you cycling and select outdoor cycling in workout mode, it can also track distance and speed. you need to keep you phone with you with GPS turned on btw.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

Watch faces: There are 150+ watchfaces you can choose from and you can do it by using Noisefit app

Battery: The battery back up is really good and there is an option called battery saving mode which disables notification and lowers the brightness the the lowest setting which can significantly save the battery life.

UI: It comes with Noise Colorfit UI. Typical noise UI. It looks great in my opinion. It is really smooth.

Build Quality: The build quality is really good. It is not metal but it has really premium touch to it also the curved class. it just makes the watch look premium

Water resistance: it has IP68 water, dust and dirt resistance. I have summerged the watch in water and there is no problem

Overall : It is a really good smart watch and very good looking smartwatch in my opinion. You should go for this watch if you want LOOKS, BETTER DISPLAY, LAG FREE UI.",269,1
Bass is OVERRATED!, Best watch in this price range. Don't worry about the brightness it is lowest (minimun) in this image. It's light weight and no lag in software compatible with Android. It has multiple options which are really useful. Go for it.,249,1
not great,"Noise Colorfit Pulse Grande is an amazing and a premium looking watch.
The curved glass gives it a very classy look. Plastic used is very sturdy, and strap is of good quality.
The touch is very responsive.
The best part about this watch is the user interface, which is very simple and feature loaded with multiple watch faces.
Battery is pretty good, it can easily go upto 5-5 days.
Brightness is also a good feature, anyone can see the display under sunlight with brightness set at level 3 (the watch has 5 levels of brightness)
All the sensors work very well and are accurate (I compared with other watches and the results were similar)
Bluetooth connectivity is fast
NoiseFit application is very good and has a great UI.
All in all, it is a very good smartwatch and a must buy under a budget.",170,1

All features works perfectly but don't know how accuracate it is.

For 1999 it's a value for money.. kids are enjoying as they place a new watch face every day. Plus alarm function helps to get up on time as it vibrates pretty well. Wished it had gps function so that we can keep a track of kids when they go down to play..

Only one watch face can be downloaded at a time. U need to delete earlier one to download a new one. It's sad...",175,5
"Don't go with the rating, not worth a penny","The watch is really good in design.

Loved the flat dial.

Also, the display is really good looking at the price point.

Battery lasts around 6-7 days as promised with Bluetooth connected full day.

I switch off the Bluetooth at night.

Loved the new feature of on screen flash.

The heart rate monitor and the stress test is good.

Also, I liked the handwash/water reminders.

Basically the watch is worth the price.

I bought it at ₹2000 launch price.",36,5
defective left ear piece. You may be next victim of this.,"I was looking for a replacement for my heavy watch and this is a decent Watch that kinda ticks most of the boxes. I wanted a light one, yes this is good. As I have a thin arm, the size is good. ( actually a bit big but it is easier to read messages through this).

Quickly the pluses and minuses :

Pluses :
1. Light
2. Easy to set up
3. Lovely battery back up - as of now 8th day and going strong 38%
4. Alarm works well ( I travel a lot so vibrating alarm is very useful)
5. Reading quickly messages , rejecting calls is a boon

Minuses :
1. Sometimes getting connected to phone can be a challenge
2. Watch faces - not so impressive
3. American system of month- date can be irritating
4. There is a slight lag before the time comes upbut kinda got used to it. ( pull/ push it up the arm- it works fine) .

Havent used it for rides /runs so cant say much about that. HR also has to be checked with the Garmin chest strap / BP monitor ( will do soon).

I got it @ 1990",29,5

Worst experience with Boat 441 Airdopes. Feels cheated by the seller and Amazon for the first time.,"Writing this review after 10 days of use

Pros-
1.This watch is compact in size which is very good neither very big nor very small.
2.Battery backup is very impressive, charging after first time the battery backup was nearly of 8 days
3.It has a slight curve display.
4.Touch response is also very good.
5.Side button is also very responsive.

Cons-
1.It has a slight bigger screen notch at the bottom.
2.Sleeping meter does not work properly.
3.Noisefit app have only limited no. Of wallpapers for the watch , company should add more and more wallpapers in the app for the customers with time.

Conclusion-
You can consider this watch it is a very good value for money yes it has some cons in it but it is obvious that you can't get all the features at this price point. So just go for it it is a valuable for money produc👍👍👍",11,5
Boat airdrops 441...... really horrible and disappointing 😔😔,"The only feature that's stand out is, quick response (as of now)
Which others will emulate soon.

However - there is a Major issue with App connectivity. Once you get disconnected like if you use battery saver, you will have to reset (its the only option) which will reset all data.

Imagine doing this frequently.😅
But Then we must weigh everything against the price. That's what u get at this price point, not sure if this can be fixed by any update.",5,5
Best beautiful looking watch @Rs 1999,"This watch is one of the best for its price.
Display:
The display shows deep blacks which looks like an Amoled even though this is a TFT panel. Quality of display is too good. It may catch scratches if used roughly. The Watchfaces which contain black will look great.

Fitness tracking:
Fitness tracking is good not too accurate but for the price it is good. Sensors are also good but don't rely on them for serious purpose. But it doesn't have a temperature sensor which Caliber has.

Build:
Build is plastic or polycarbonate but it is durable. It may catch scratches in the long run.

Battery:
Battery is good. If you use it connected all day to phone then you'll get 3 to 4 days of backup but if you use it just for time and step counting without connecting to phone then you can get upto 20 days of backup or even more.",7,5
Overall a good product!,"So this smart watch is a really good smart watch so here are some pros and cons-
Pros-
1.Build quality is really good.Material used for strap is comfortable but can be itchy.
2. Heart rate and other functions are accurate but don't give the perfect number.
3.Really smooth and fancy ui with everything needed for a smart at this budget.
4.Infinite watch faces are there as you can set custom watchface from your gallery technically giving you infinite watch faces.
5.Dosent measure HR of air 😂😂
Cons-
1.Step monitor is a bit inaccurate.
2. Dependent on phone as alarm,reminders etc can only be set using phone.
3. The battery is a bit low but i am not too sure as i am using the watch alot so yeah.
Overall Review-
I havent used any other smart watch so i don't have any idea for other smart watches but this smart watch is really good it's really useful for its budget of 2000 . So If you want a good smart watch with smooth ui, good screen size,all ages strap size and sensors which don't measure HR of air 😂😂😂😂😂 then you should definitely go for this watch if you can buy it for ₹2000",5,5
"Awesome watch, truly India’s calling smartwatch","Wow! This is a good smart watch for calling. Also have to much featurs like 60 sports mode, sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, spo2 monitoring ect at this price. Large display and stylesh looks of the smart watch make this watch more atractive. But there have some issues I faced after using 2 days. Some time this watch forget to count foot steps and wrist awake not working properly. Also it has some hanging problem, stuck on call page.
After all this is good for daily use. Strong battery life of this smart watch gives you 3 days service (when connect with bluetooth). Without mobile connect it ran 5-6 days.",7,5

3. Sleep Tracker - After using it for a week. The results are fair.
4. SpO2 feature is amazing, not sure about accuracy.
5. HEART RATE And STRESS are good feature to Track healthy life.
6. Easily connected to GOOGLE FIT and its NoiseApp gives you all data on phone very easy to use and simple to understand.
7. Phone notifications are quick there is no delay. Even messages can be read.

Best looking smart watch under 2500,Everything is fine but watch face transmission is bad. It is taking maximum 10 to 12 minutes for updation otherwise watch is good and while in power saving mode there is no notifications update. Have to remove the power saving mode for notifications,6,4
Best watch,"Device looks premium. Device quality is good for the price. Touch response is good. Heart rate and spo2 measurements are good. Pedometer accuracy is good. Call quality is good for indoors. Difficult to hear in outdoor Crowded conditions. Watch strap is good for the price. Wrist awake feature is bit slow compared to other devices.

Software needs a lot of improvement. Wrist awake feature and pedometer doesn't work once you wear the watch after a bath break or keeping the device aside for sometime. I have seen this issue in 2 devices. We need to power off and on to make it work again.

Wanted the settings to disable wrist awake at night while sleeping (setting time for this), other companies provide this basic feature. Annoying to see the light glowing at night.

Overall device is good for the price, but the device software and noise prime software needs a lot of improvement.",4,4
Amazing Watch,"Observations :

1) touch screen is laggging
2) Wake wrist function not working after 2 hrs of use.
3) 5 watch face at a time can store in watch

5) vital statistics are all false readings.",6,4
Worthy product on this price range,"I have been using this device for over two weeks now and these are the three points which i would like to review.

First of all .. the connectivity issues are really bad. Though the Bluetooth stays 'on' in my phone the device gets frequently disconnected. Once the watch is disconnected the only thing which you can do is factory reset the watch. Thereby losing all the data for the day like number of steps and calories data. In case if we need to know the heart beat pattern throughout the day it's not possible because the heart beat is measured only when we prompt it to do.

Second thing is the sleep monitoring.... The sleep monitoring doesn't work really... Even after you wear it whole night it still believes that I haven't slept at all.

Third is the accuracy... It's not accurate the steps count and other data which the watch displays is definitely not accurate whether it's of the heart beat or stress. But again at this price point can't really expect much from it. The screen display, watch strap quality, battery life are value for money.",4,4
Best in segment display, I dont know why its sensor is measuring in air and with water bottle. Its screen is also not working properly.pls check it if u are also goona buy it,3,4
Fine,"Everything in this product is good except the most important thing i:e it doesn't connect to my phone after pairing it, I did everything Turn Bluetooth on for both devices, reset, literally everything to make it connect but it doesn't. First when I scaned the QR code to pair with the watch, it worked perfectly fine but then it doesn't connect after that at all. I even replaced the product, still doesn't connect. My device is Honor 8x, I don't know if this issue is only in my device or all devices but yall better first confirm that then buy it.",Helpful,4
Value for money,"The touch, sleep tracking and other sensors do as they're supposed to but the build is kinda cheap...the colour comes off the body after a month or two and the band gets dirty quick and it isn't easy to get it clean again...and the app is kinda crappy they show the heartbeat but the data is presented in a weird and difficult to read kinda way....also the stress sensor doesn't stay on all the time nor the spo2 it only turns on when you use it ....soo yeah ...I maybe should have gone for the mi band or firebolt",One,4
Lovely Design and Worth the price,"I have faced these issues.
1. Watchface sync takes too much time.
2. Watch automatically Reboots
3. Contacts saved on watch shows only icon. Number not displayed.

All above mentioned 2,3 issues are working fine.
But found new issues. 😂
1. Can't able to choose system app to push notifications",Helpful,4
Simple watch that ticks most of the boxes,"-Build quality it is plastic body which feels cheap but due to which it becomes light weight

Jst go for it before opting for an expensive one...to try a smart watch life style...,"At the cost of 3299/3499 and MRP of Rs 4999, you can not expect TFT LCD screen. Display vision is damn poor.

Good Deal at this price point.,"Purchased this during the sale and this is my usage review:

1. Activity tracker has so many bugs. Steps sensor's sensitivity is so high that even if Iove hand a inch, it counts that as a step.
2. Sleep tracker : seems it is Completely hardcoded feature. Does not count any sleep which you take during daytime. And also not able to maintain sleep data for past days correctly.
3. WhatsApp notification ; even if you mark as delete from watch, notifications will keep on computer on watch if any new message arrives. Quite irritating.",One,3
Feature rich - but major App connectivity issue,"The watch would not connect to the app. I posted on twitter. I was asked to send my number on Twitter. I did. For 4 days, there was no response. After that, there were 3 calls to understand the problem. Not sure why I wrote on twitter. Post this, I returned the watch to Amazon and got it replaced. Luckily the new one works. What surprises me is that a young brand pumping in money thru brand ambassadors, does not have a service setup. The service website does not open or work. Call centre is focussed on what excuse to put to close the ticket. No one is interested in actually solving the problem for the customer.

I recommend not to buy this brand at all. I felt conned.",2,3
"Great Watch For the Price, Go for it!","The watch display show only 70% of a color comparing to the watches faces you see in mobile phone.

It looks like a watch head is just sticked on a hand rubber band which i personally dont feel good",One,3
Really satisfied with the product at this price.,"Activity tracker is not good. It count foot steps while driving or even if you move your hands while sleeping.

1. syncing activity with app is a pain in the ass.

True review after some year of product use.,"In fact let me confess that I have been using all sorts of cameras , point and shoot, travel, high zoom, DSLR s for well over two decades. And as a compulsive camera buyer, i buy cameras without any rhyme or reason. So far I have been using either Canon or Nikon, but this time I decided to go for Sony.......

Recently my small canon point and shoot I had gifted to my friend and hence decided to go for Sony. I chanced upon SONY DCS W830 . I bought the camera on Amazon with very high hopes about the picture quality,ease of use,good optics, but frankly I am disappointed on following points about the camera. The delivery by Amazon is world-Class, super fast and with very good service.

Build quality is not up to the mark. you can feel it. The top plate on the camera which houses shutter and on-off button is very loose. My one day old camera is already showing that this plate may fall off anytime. Secondly , the buttons are so flush on the top plate that even before you struggle to find the button, it operates without you feeling it lock the focus. Even on-off button needs some effort to locate and switch on. In any camera half press shutter locks the focus This Camera locks the focus but even a slightly more pressure. on shutter releases the shutter, causing out of focus pics.

Picture quality initially looks good. But I may have to shoot under different conditions to verify that whether the picture quality is in keeping with SONY Quality. Which I believe is top class . Just now I downloaded few pics shot on this camera, and I found them to be of average quality.

I bought the camera for its Zeiss Lens, Sony's famous software, and the name sony is a guarantee in itself. I very well know that this particular camera is 5 year old model. and Sony may no longer be manufacturing this model, but if these are the deficiencies which persist, then why Sony is still market ting it. It may have adverse impact.

I also feel that one has to find out whether the product is genuine Sony or some sub-standard stuff is being palmed off as genuine sony product.

I will use it for few more days and write again on my experience about this camera.",42,4

Not worth the value,"Canon 6D Mark II is the most anticipated camera after 5D Mark IV in recent times, whilst we have been expecting its launch from October 2016. Finally, I have the pleasure of both using and reviewing it, which is quite a pleasing experience till now. The introduction of 6D Mark II came after a long wait of 5 years since the inception of 6D, thereby packed with much changes and technological advancements.

:::::::::::::::::::: Why 6D Mark II ? ::::::::::::::::::::
Whenever there is a launch of the new model, we are faced with an ever gripping question – Should I buy it?
Before elaborating on it, I would like you to know two things if you are sticking to Canon:
a) 5D Mark III – Almost unavailable in the market.
b) 5D Mark IV – Costs almost double than 6D Mark II.

:::::::::::::::::::: Positives ::::::::::::::::::::
After my hands on the device and using it for few weeks, I am quite satisfied with it. Some of the noticeable advantages of the Mark II are summarized below:

1) Extremely Cost Efficient Full Frame Camera - 6D Mark II is the most cost-effective DSLR among all the Canon EOS Full Frame devices and stands tall with technological advancements.

2) Significant Technological Upgrades - There have been significant technological upgrades as compared to 6D model and its presence is felt with each passing click. The changes are:
i) Resolution: Mark II flaunts 26.2MP, an increase from 20.6MP.
ii) Digital Imaging Integrated Circuit (DIGIC): There has been an upgrade to DIGIC 7, up from the available DIGIC 5+ in 6D. DIGIC 7 is much efficient in the handling of the heavy image file, thereby saving them to the memory much faster than DIGIC 5+.
iii) Focus Points: 45 autofocus points (all cross type), a jump from 11 autofocus points (centre cross type). However, the autofocus points are seemed to be crammed at the centre, like all other full frame cameras. Naturally, the presence of all cross type helps in fast focusing.
iv) Frames per Second (fps): Both the Canon’s 6D supports 1080p recording, but, the fps rate has been raised from 30fps to 60fps.
v) Weather Resistant: 6D Mark II has debuted the weather resistant feature which is a ‘cherry on the cake’.

3) ISO - Mark II has normal ISO in the range of 100 to 40,000 and it can be extended to the range of 50 to 1,02,4000. The video ISO, however, has the range in between 100 to 25,600.
In most of the cases, the noise will be negligible while taking pictures in ISO 1600 and even the clicks taken in ISO range of 3200 to 6400 will be usable for most purposes. However, it is to be noted that the option of using the pictures on occasions will continue to be diminished as we increase the ISO from 1600. Many use the ETTR (Expose To The Right) strategy to lower the noise in pictures, however, doing so can have slight issues in Dynamic Range, in comparison to other DSLRs. I was expecting Mark II to handle the Dynamic Range better, but it is not the case.

4) Availability of Remote Shutter App - Canon has application both for Android and Apple devices which communicates with the camera via Wi-Fi. You can use the app for camera remote, image viewing, to name a few. It is indeed a positive approach of Canon in ‘delighting us always’.

5) Lightest in the Class - The total weight of the body along with the battery stands at mere 765gms. According to the Canon website, it is the lightest DSLR in the EOS Full Frame line up. Having a light full frame camera in everyday life is such a relief that I cannot sketch my excitement in words.

6) Vari-Angle Touch Panel - The Mark II is packed with a vari-angle touch panel which has multiple benefits. It helps in varied angle photos, while touch panel has packed in ease of the touch.

7) Digital 5 Axis Image Stabilization - Mark II is also pampered with Digital 5 Axis Image Stabilization which makes it quite easy to record video, nullifying the effects of unintentional shakes, both vertical or horizontal. It is highly useful while recording at 1080p, in both 30 and 60 fps.

:::::::::::::::::::: Negatives ::::::::::::::::::::
Even the best performing devices have flaws in it and these are some of the shortcomings, I cannot seem to ignore:

1) Missing Inbuilt Flash -- Following the trend, the Mark II lacks an inbuilt flash which did not come to me as a surprise. Though it does not affect my decision of owning it as I do not prefer using on-camera flash under any situation, it might be disappointing to few.

2) Menu Driven Controls -- Mark II lacks dedicated control buttons and is infused with menu driven controls. Usually, the professionals who are involved in photography for a long time will surely find bit uneasy using the menu-driven controls as it will not only delay their performance but also will lead to frustration. We wish for hassle-free experience while using a camera and this feature has surely not helped the cause.

3) Single SD Card Slot -- Not having a second slot clearly hinders the peace of mind and we have to constantly keep track of the storage. While the liberty of saving different image formats in separate cards is shattered, not having a backup of the picture is tad terrifying.

4) Missing 4K Videography -- I was in high hopes for the Mark II launch and hands-on with 4K videography was one the vital reason for it. It surely came to me as a shock that Mark II has no 4K videography, but, taking the price bracket into consideration it surely doesn’t make me disappointed.

:::::::::::::::::::: Miscellaneous ::::::::::::::::::::
These are some of the features which I could not include either add in pros or cons:
1) Mark II has backward compatibility with lenses from past 30 years, with the exception of APS-C camera’s EF-S / EF-M lenses.
2) There is no option for adjusting LCD’s Brightness but is sufficiently bright for most occasions.
3) The image quality of Mark II seems identical to the range of 5D S / SRs. It is to be however noted that the hard-core professionals, using their professional skills might find some enhancements which will have no effect on either normal or semi-professional user.

:::::::::::::::::::: Conclusion ::::::::::::::::::::
Taking all points into consideration, I would term this a good buy. The close competitor to Canon 6D Mark II will be Nikon D750, which is a 3 years’ old model. In my opinion, Nikon D750 produces the same picture quality, despite being cheaper than Canon Mark II. However, the video quality on 6D Mark II is much better than D750.

It will be an ideal buy for those who are considering owning a Canon full frame camera. Also, one who wishes to upgrade from 6D can definitely think of it as an option due to the added advantages as discussed in the review.

4k in EOS RP doesn't have proper codec or DPAF so it's useless. Also, the 3.5 frames per sec is too slow.

no memory card,"This is my review about the product received and initial testing of about 1000 photos and a few videos.

First the package - As shown in the pictures and described. No complains.
Delivery time - spot on, received it under 48 hours of order.
Packaging - Decent enough, no complains
Sealed box - check
Inside the box - Camera, lens, battery, charger, strap. everything there and intact.
Warranty - registered the products without any issues for a 2 year warranty.

Initial impressions of the camera and lens.
Boy is it heavy!!!
The Camera and lens together feel heavy if you are coming from ceop sensor cameras. Good heavy I mean. Feels solid.

The camera menu takes some getting used to though. But the touch screen makes it easy to navigate around different settings

The Lens! Simply wow. The flexibility you get with this lens is just awesome. Without compromising on image quality at any focal length (unless you pixel peep around the edges at 24 or 105).

Images are crisp and clean with great color science. Dont need to edit much with colours post. Although the shadows and highlights may need some tweaking when shooting low light. Also noticed over exposure when shooting Aperture priority, need pulling down during or post clicking.
Get a 70 MBps plus UHS 1 card for burst, else the lag is significant.
Decent Videos at 1080 24, 30 and 60. Not much to talk about here.

Canon EOS 6D ii,"I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.
Update 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced.",72,5

2) Battery 🔋 can't even hold a month if not using. Once I charge the device to full capacity it doesn't last a month on stand by. In case of emergency shoot it is not a good companion

Love Nikon D850,"I bought this as a spare camera for my kids because it share the same control of my FZ1000. FZ80 has x60 zoom which is better than my FZ1000 x16 and it is amazing. It can take a picture of the moon surface. Both camera do not do well in low light but FZ80 clearly handicapped by the smaller sensor. In bright daylight, the FZ80 4k video look amazing but the color is less vibrant as compare to the FZ1000. In indoor lighting, the color balance of the FZ80 is off and the video show more noise and pixelation. FZ80 is definitely a good 4K camera for beginner but just not good enough to shoot serious event like wedding. For less than half the price of the FZ1000, it worth every penny as a 4K camera if this fall within your price range. With Optical Image Stabilization, ISO, F-Stop and Shutter control, it can definitely take picture better than your expensive cell phone.",One,5

Camera,"If you are a beginner photographer and looking for a bridge camera, you might immediately think of brands like Nikon and Canon, which have stood the test of time. While I too was inclined toward these brands, I also wanted a camera that packed a decent zoom just to give me that extra bit of flexibility without having to pack several lenses when travelling.

Having used this camera extensively for around 6 weeks in a variety of lighting conditions, in cities and in the country, I can say that it does not disappoint. The build quality feels solid and it can easily be carried around for a few hours without too much effort.

The Intelligent Auto + (iA+), which the camera is set to by default, does a good job at recognizing particular scene types and adjusting the exposure accordingly. In this mode, you still have control of a number of parameters, including exposure value compensation ( which effectively changes the aperture) and white balance. Image stabilization is smooth even at the longer end of the telephoto range, providing you use the electronic viewfinder and cradle the lens barrel as you take the shot. Telephoto image quality can be improved considerably with the use of a tripod. The lens itself extends and retracts quickly and smoothly, while autofocus easily finds the subject. You can also select the focus point yourself using the touchscreen if you are not satisfied.

There are times, for example in low light conditions or indoors, where the camera may select the wrong scene type and completely muck up the exposure. In these cases I would select either Program Auto or Manual modes to get more control over shutter speed and aperture. Bearing in mind the small sensor, the camera's handheld performance in low light is passable. If you anticipate doing a decent amount of low light photography, I would suggest buying a cheap but stable tripod and using Manual modes to adjust exposure. Just remember to turn image stabilization off to prevent unwanted artifacts smearing the image.

Those looking for creative control over depth of field similar to what a DSLR can offer will be disappointed. This is not a fixed aperture lens. The camera's aperture range at 20mm EFL is F/2.8- F8, but at 100mm is only F/5.9 to F8. this makes it hard to achieve shallow depth of field at the lower focal lengths, although it is still possible at longer focal lengths providing you use a smaller aperture such as F/2.8 or F4 and correspondingly faster shutter speeds. Having said that, depth of field at the wide angle setting does not change significantly between F/4 and F8. I would argue that F/4 is a better setting for landscapes as you get less softening of the image.

You can see some of the images below this review which I have taken using this camera. The resolution, sharpness and detail are more than adequate for the amateur enthusiast. One great feature is the built-in WiFi, which makes transferring images to your smartphone a doddle.

One of the great strengths of this camera is the 4K video, which is not generally found at this price range. While 4K only shoots for 15 minutes at a time due to the risk of overheating, you can still shoot in 1080p for as long as you want.

In conclusion, this is a great camera for this price and can easily adapt to any situation and help you build your photography skills for years to come. Would I buy it again? Absolutely.",One,4

All in one Hand…!!!,How much warrenty & Gurenty of fz80,10,4
Good Product,"Excellent value for the money. Photos are better than expected. You should not of course be compared to a DSLR. But I find I use it more than my 'better' Canon 6D. The problem with high end cameras is finding suitable subjects that use the camera's full capabilities. Its only weakness is for landscape photography. But for everything else, it is as good as one would want. Even a professional can carry it as a backup capera, though it is not a professional camera.
It is priced too high. I bought it from a private dealer for less than half the amazon price. It is enough to make one wonder if DSLRs are headed the same way as top line rangefinder cameras like Leica that are now little more than collector items.In addition companies like Panasonic and Sony have huge resources and technology compared to specialist camera makers.",19,3
More than it's money s worth,"camera is excellent, but its original price is around 21k and in local market you can get it in 17k",92,5
Good camera to purchase... But not in amazon.in,"Excellent quality, great features - amazing telephoto zoom! Good all-around camera.",25,5
I like this prouct bcos from past 1,"I purchased this to replace my 11 year old Nikon D70 DSLR. If I had many thousands of dollars set aside to buy a new DSLR and the long-range telephoto lenses I'd need to get anywhere close to the zoom this camera has, I would. A true DSLR has a larger sensor, resulting in clearer photos and typically a range of options over and above what a camera like this LUMIX has.

That said - I'm not a professional photographer, and the photo quality from this camera is exceptionally adequate for my purposes. I chose this particular camera after a lot of research because the length of the telephoto zoom vs the price was unbeatable. I do a lot of hiking, and end up taking pictures of a lot of wildlife - and often you're a great distance away from these animals. A more typical zoom wouldn't allow you to get some of those shots. People have remarked that the photos I've shown them are amazing, and that I must have 'quite the professional camera to get shots like that.' There's definitely nothing wrong with the quality of the photos you'll get from this camera - as long as you keep some things in mind (lighting, bracing the camera for a steady shot when using the long zoom, etc).

Pros:
- Super-long 60x zoom (1200mm equiv)
- Optical Image stabilization (great for those super-long handheld shots)
- Automatic HDR using multiple images with back-lit subjects - ever taken a picture of a group of people with the sun in the background, only to find the pictures shows a silhouette of the people as they're too dark to see given the light behind them? This automatically fixes that.
-Great video quality too - and the microphone seems to work really well even in the wind
- Enough controls to do a lot manually if you want - control shutter speed, aperture, etc. - or leave it in auto and let the camera decide
- Build in creative effects if you're into that

Cons:
- Not water resistant or dust/sand resistant at all - makes me nervous to take it some places
- Hard to tell how much battery you have left on the screen or in the viewfinder before it gets to low battery
- This is sort of a pro and a con - but it has some internal memory - so you can actually take a number of photos without a memory card in it. This is great until you forget to put your memory card in. I typically turn on my camera and snap a pic of the wall on the way out the door just to ensure came is charged, memory card in place, etc - but it got me with this one.

I took all of the photos here with this camera, and all were taken hand-held, no tripod. I think amazon scales down the images for the review - so obviously these aren't at full resolution, but I think they show what you can do...",12,5
Four Stars,Report abuse,4,5
Excellent value for the money,"AWESOME ZOOM, poor low light action shots, no focus ring, FAST FPS, Great bargain at $300",One,5
price is very high,"Pros:
The zoom is truly awesome in this. No SLR lens can compare. It's great for birdwatching, zooming in on a face in the crowd, wildlife shots, and even just cool stuff that's a long way away.
4k video is great. I'm a Canon SLR person and they don't have 4k in the low or mid-range for an SLR, so that's why I got this and it is great.
Fast FPS. The camera can take 4k video, which is 8mp at 30fps. It claims it will do it in 4k Burst mode, which really means it takes a 4k video and will show you frame by frame and let you select ones to make photos. Horrible to do on the camera's screen, I wound up getting software that would do it on my PC and just pulling all the images out. Which you can do from any video, so this is an ineffective feature (at least for me). I wanted something that would create 30 images/second, which I could go through on a real screen and post quickly. As this feature is why I chose the Lumix over a Nikon, I'm a little annoyed at their implementation.
Cons:
Low light conditions for moving subjects are awful. To the point that you will have low light issues in places you didn't realize were low light, and there is no ""action"" choice on the selector. The F2.8 for the lens in wide isn't matched by a very sensitive sensor, or it's not automatically upping the sensitivity as needed. I have a ton of blurry shots of my kids because of this. I've played with the light levels and it is cludgey at best, completely ineffective at worst. I've hit a sweet spot a couple of times by setting it to 1/60th of a second, but it still has issues (and my kids aren't that fast). This is an AMAZING outdoor daytime camera, but for kids in a bounce house it doesn't work for me.
No Focus Ring, so obstructed zoom is hit or miss. Generally, zoom and autofocus are fantastic and FAST. This means that taking a picture of wildlife that is partially obstructed by a branch means that you may get a fantastic shot of a leaf instead of the Pileated Woodpecker you were trying for. Also, since the aperture only goes to F-8, there's a limit to how much depth you can get so that crystal clear leaf may only be 6 inches closer than the woodpecker, but, oh well.
Very limited options on the selection wheel. They've got the fab 5 (auto, P, A, S, M), then Expressive (for filters), Portrait, Panoramic, C? (maybe custom, but defaults to 1080p/60fps), and then Video (for adjusting settings in video mode)
My last complaint is the smallest, the features (like C above) are poorly explained on screen (aperture is only ""A"", which isn't useful to noobs), which means that Panasonic style features are not understandable to people with more experience. I accidentally turned on the feature of take 3 shots and merge them which doesn't work for kids moving (but would be great for landscape shots). Missed 1/2 of my kids' Karate class trying to fix it instead of taking pictures.

Overall, this is an AWESOME camera if you are taking zoomed pictures or videos in sunlight, or of non-moving subjects. The autofocusing on a leaf can be annoying, but survivable. The wifi, etc. is nice but not particularly useful for me. I have tested it and it'd be great to put on a monopod and use your phone to selection shots in a crowd. And for $300, no SLR can compare on value. However, once Canon comes out with the T8i, if the 4k is good, I'll likely put this on craigslist. Because of the crappy low light, I still use my Canon T4i if I'm going somewhere like the Baltimore Aquarium or Natural History Museum with my boys, and this camera should have put my T4i to bed.",5,5

best pocket camera for every purpose,I use this camera mostly for video as a replacement to an older Bridge camera. I am impressed by the results and the good price for what you get. I shoot mostly in 1080p but have tried the 4K video of this camera with excellent results. I tested stills shooting birds at high ISO and shutter speeds and it performed well considering the small sensor size. All in all I am happy with the purchase. One note if you are going to shoot a lot of video consider purchasing an external charger and extra batteries as the battery does not last all that long in video mode particularly if you are like me and use the viewfinder more than the screen. The LVF uses more power. Keep in ind that video is limited to 30mins per video in 1080p and 15 mins per video in 4K. My only complaint so far is the lens cap. The finger tabs on the front that you squeeze to release the cap stick out. If they touch anything at all including pulling the camera out of a photo bag the cap will fall off. You are guaranteed to lose it if you walk around with the cap on and brush against something and the cap is not tethered.,One,4

WOW... WHAT A CAMERA... UNBELIVEBABLE,"This is an excellent camera, the build quality, image quality and feature set are right up there with most entry level DSLRs. I bought this camera for the long zoom, but I am a bit disappointed: the 60x zoom is based on the lowest focal length of the lens, which is the wide angle 20mm. This means that although the full zoom range of the lens is from 20mm to 1200mm (which is technically 60x), the effective telephoto zoom (over the standard view 50mm) is only 24x. As such, the camera does not provide the level of magnification at a distance that I was hoping for. Shame on me for not reading the description carefully enough.

Unfortunately the OIS makes a constant noise, louder when zoomed, and the zoom itself is even louder, which is audible on any video recording, thus making it useless for recording something like a bird singing.

Good for overall performance,"When you pay 300 bucks for a 4K camera, I guess you have to understand there will be limitations. I have worked with Lumix before on a much higher end level, and their camera's are AWESOME.

When the camera is in decent to good lighting it works very well. Once the lighting starts to fade the quality almost instantly turns to pixelated garbage. During Christmas I was shooting some test footage of my family around the tree, and the results were terrible. Between the artifacts, pixelation and the camera having a hard time focusing I was very disappointed. I also was filming my black cat and the camera couldnt focus, couldnt translate the scenario. I grabbed my 80D to see if it was just a tough situation to focus on... but the 80D did just fine.

This camera should ONLY be used in controlled lighting or daytime ventures... this camera will probably be a great one for you, especially with the price. But if you are going to encounter darker rooms or places, shadows, low light environments... I would suggest getting a camera with a better lens than F2.8-5.9... and a system that can deal with low lighting better.",One,4

Good Camera for beginners,"I really loved this camera, it was very easy to use and the zoom was excellent. I took tons of excellent photographs (mostly birdwatching and landscapes), and carried it with me in several international trips. Then about three years after I bought it the zoom stopped working with no warning, one day I just starting getting an error message every single time I tried to zoom in, and had to restart the camera. I always took good care of it, and after getting the error message I completely cleaned it with compressed air, as I thought it might be getting stuck because of dust. Nothing worked and now I have a normal camera with no zoom whatsoever, which was the reason I bought the camera in the first place. I think that for the price it should have lasted free of problems for a lot longer. I read several reviews from other users stating that they got the same problem, some of them even sooner after purchasing the camera, so I think this is a defect in the design of the product. Even though I liked it a lot I would not buy it again.",6,3

Valuable.,Very Bad Image Quality,2,3
For beginners,"I bought this camera for the excellent zoom range and the ability to shoot video. Based on other reviews I had read, I didnt expect it to perform as badly as it did. In my case, the cons heavily outweighed the pros, and I decided I’d have to return the camera.

Pros:

- small and lightweight for the huge zoom range.
-relatively inexpensive compared to other cameras of its type.
-good battery life.
-lots of handy features, like the built in wifi, USB charging, and the smartphone app.

Cons:

-extremely disappointing image quality is its worst feature. It can not produce an acceptable image in any conditions. The noise produced by the sensor is unacceptable even at iso 80. For this reason it is useless to me. I thought it would have been at least as good as my entry level dslr (Nikon d40), that’s 10 years old, but it’s much worse.
- video mode is also very disappointing and did not live up to my expectations. It struggles to produce noise free video in most situations, but it is slightly better than in stills mode.
- the image stabilization is very loud, and does not work very well. Also when handheld or even sitting on a solid surface it jitters horizontally for no reason.
- when moving from areas of different temperature of humidity, the lens fogs up (which is normal I know), but it takes and incredibly long time for it to recover and become clear again.
-the auto focus works well at wide angles, but struggles at any telephoto focal length...and if it’s raining or snowing, I wan not able to get the camera to focus at all past the closest snowflakes. It would lock onto the snow but not the subject.

Overall the thing that made me decide to return this camera was the sub-par image quality...the most important thing in a camera to me.",One,3

Best crop sensor DSLR for photo & videography in 50k,I'm so sad I bought this camera. I wish I could return it. My last three cameras have been smaller Lumix point and shoots and I have LOVED them. I thought this one would be really fun with the zoom but it's been a huge disappointment. I don't enjoy using it (it's bulky and heavy) and I don't like the pictures that I get. They're nowhere near as crisp and beautiful as with my previous Lumix cameras. I wonder if it's because my previous ones had Leica lenses and this one doesn't appear to?

VERY BAD DON'T BUY IT MEMORY CARD IS NOT WORKING IN IT,"Zoom range is great although quality drops off a both ends as expected on this class of camera. What was really disappointing (caught me totally by surprise) is that the panorama is really low resolution. Nothing approaching the full capability of the sensor. In a horizontal sweep the best vertical resolution is 1920 pixels. You are limited to the vertical field of view of the sensor in landscape mode. But you don't even get the 3672 pixels of vertical sensor resolution. You get a down sampled 1920 pixels. See page 66 of the advanced manual for the sad details on pano specs. Also, there is no way to shoot a horizontal panorama holding the camera in portrait orientation to get a bit more FOV and resolution.
Ok for posting online but not for printing. But even posting online, you can't zoom into it without pixelating right away.
Disappointing because virtually any smartphone will allow you to making a horizontal pano using portrait orientation and will thus allow you to have at least 2 to 4x the vertical resolution of the FZ-80. Even the less desirable landscape orientation on a smart phone will give 2x the vertical resolution for a horizontal pano. I will be returning it and select another 60x superzoom/bridge cam that allows full sensor resolution and also allows portrait mode camera orientation for horizontal panos.",Helpful,5

I've missed thousands of shots because the lense wants to refocus every single shot, even after I've locked in a focal range & target to be focused on. Like someone else here said: This is a TOY. Buy it if you have $300 to blow, if you have lots of spare time to waste waiting for it to refocus & refocus & refocus & refocus..., if you don't really care about getting that shot because you'll be disappointed a 1,000 times, otherwise it's not worth the frustration.

Because there is no public internet for the western world, I couldn't even google instructions. The first 650 photos I took were in a movie format (30 or 60 frames/shot). This meant I couldn't even post a photo or send one due to the gigantic size. It was so frustrating--hundreds of pictures of Xian, the terra cotta warriors, the pandas in Chengdu--all unsharable. After almost 3 weeks of traveling, we boarded a ship in Hong Kong (with the internet) and I was able to change the setting on the camera. When I returned home I had to go through each picture and delete all but one frame, a task that took a week. Now it's too late to share photos.

And then, last month, I spent a month in Australia and New Zealand and I *thought* I could figure out how to use this camera, However.........
There are so many bloomin' buttons on the front of the camera that I would inadvertently touch one and suddenly my photos were in black and white. I'm in the middle of Hobbiton where the LORD OF THE RINGS movies were shot and I'm trying to figure out how to change the setting back to color. Other buttons would change a filter so no photo was viewable or I was no longer able to film inside--my photos would almost be black. Thank goodness my husband had an old Canon PandS camera or I would have missed out on most of the indoor shots.

"Poor compatibility, not recommended","I guess for $400, what more could we expect? We read the ratings - and there are a lot of them on Amazon - and thought we were purchasing a great 4K camera to replace our Canon Rebel T2i, which at this point is over 10 years old (released February 2010). No. Just, no. There's no comparison between these cameras and a true DSLR. If I want a point-n-shoot camera, why would I want one this huge with far less features than even a regular point-n-shoot?

1.) There's no audio input, so right there should've warned me off this camera. You can't hook up an external mic to this camera, and they don't even bother telling you that because they know it's such a basic feature that to mention it would crush the sales of this camera. Bad move, Panasonic.
2.) The touchscreen doesn't swivel out and around. Sure, there's an app, but wouldn't it be easy and inexpensive to offer a pivoting LCD screen? How much more cost could that add?
3.) The 4K 30fps video capture is abysmal quality. I have a Logitech StreamCam 1080p/60fps and it has demonstrably better picture quality and color depth than this piece of trash LUMIX. 4K pictures aren't much better. Folks, it's one thing to advertise 4K, but the quality of the 4K matters as well. More pixels doesn't always equal better picture quality. This camera's quality is crap. Our 10-year-old Canon Rebel T2i has better picture quality at 1080p/30fps!!

This camera is $400 retail. $400???! What are you paying for? Less features? Trash 4K video/picture quality? No thanks. Plus, the quality of the camera itself is poor.

This model is sony rx-100 mark 3 but you can also get sony rx-100 mark 4 and mark 5 ,little bit of differences and cost increases as model number increases.
i choose this one as my budget was below 50K and yes there are other options as well like CANON g7x mark 2 and i would say that one is best model for vlogging and taking pictures BUT SONY MARK 3 has some advantages over canon g7x mark 2 as well.

this model is very small,you can keep into your pocket and even you hold it in your hand for hours you wont feel any tired ness.
lets talk about what i got in PACKAGE.

- Main camera
- charger adapter and wire
- FREE POUCH to keep camera
- 8 GB FREE memory card

as there was nothing written while purchasing but YES you will get free cover and memory card so hurayyy

this camera has
NO TOUCHSCREEN

this camera has
FLIP OUT SCREEN

this comes under point and shoot category.
if you thinking to buy this for daily pictures,or youtube videos just go with it.
this is the best pocket friendly,tiniest in this price segment camera deliver by sony.

dont think i am sony fan,only thing is canon g7x mark 2 was unavailable and this was the second best choice.
moreover if you see my other reviews i have been USING CANON DSLR 80D as well.

The cost is a flip side. Priced at 54990, I don't think the cost is justified for it. Though I bough this at 45990 in an Amazon sale, I feel 35000 is a decent price for this model.",42,3
Best CCTV,"Although it has a tiltable viewfinder, making it convenient for vlogging or taking selfies, I have to state that there is distortion. It is not so apparent when you take images/ video of objects, but when you are capturing faces, there is something different.. In my case, it made my face look more oval than it is. Then I went ahead and took a picture of my toddler and his face looked leaner in the pictures too. I did try out various angles to find the best one that flattered my features, but I don't think this camera's strength is meant for such beauty vlogging. It is great, however, for general vlogging when the aoi is not just the face. The quality is crisp and i love how amazing it is in low light as well. The colours and true to the original mostly and there are tonnes of options in the camera to a la carte your settings. I had all my hopes pinned to the Zeiss lens which i would rank 95/100 on this camera. I have had Carl Zeiss lens on my mobile, and together with its algorithm gave picture quality that is till date unbeatable. Unfortunately they dont make that phone anymore. The audio function in this camera is also good. You dont need a separate mic. That said, it picks up the audio nearby and around it, unlike my canon t3i which picks up sounds even from the road adjacent to our house making the video annoyingly noisy. That was not desirable in my videos, so I am content with the Sony's. As always, the sony battery is not its forte, and it takes a long time to fully recharge the battery with the provided adapter. It came with a complimentary (?) 8 GB SD card. It also came with a camera pouch the material of which is flimsier than the grocery bad that my local departmental store provides. It is a paper-cotton blend, and poor enough to wipe glasses let alone carry a precious camera like this one.",2,3

Not impressed,"This is a very good P&S outside in well lit situations, inside the flash is practically worthless.
Depending on the mode you set it in, you can only use either fill flash or auto flash. Neither is repeatable (flash amount is different in each shot of the same subject), too hot or too low. You can add an external flash with an adapter cable (no hot shoe) but to me, it's a small camera and I don't want to carry extra gear just for interior shots. Fill flash outside is worthless in bright back lit shots, not enough power.
I bought this to shoot high quality images when I don't want to carry my DSLR. For day time exterior shots it produces lovely images in RAW, but I have to tweak white balance in Light Room for acceptable results.
Bottom line; very good P&S for outside shots, terrible low light and flash assist interior shots.

This camera fits my lifestyle. I love taking good pictures, while still having a small point-and-shoot camera that is easy to carry. Every few years, I treat myself to the best new point-and-shoot, and this was it. The digital technology is still evolving so fast, that you will have to read the reviews to see if it is still the best. It is definitely better than the nice camera on my Galaxy S5, and worth the hassle of an extra gadget when my photos can be planned.

Not good as i expect,"Having fun, shooting ""available dark"" (update: bad service from Sony's repair vendor)",4,1
Night vision is worst,"Update 9/20/15, taking off a star. I could title this update ""Still love the camera, but hate hate hate the repair process when needed"": I had a problem where the control dial was not working correctly. When you selected ""A"" for example, it might show Program on the screen, or one of the other dial functions rather than the correct one. I fully admit, I have dropped the camera, not hard, but may have caused this problem though there was no sign of damage whatsoever. The camera was working fine otherwise, but I decided to send it in for repair. Thus my complaint: Since it was still under the warranty period, I called Sony (this is what their web site tells you to do, no online service for arranging repair of this camera), which was not too aggravating, and was verbally directed to send it to Precision Camera in Enfield, CT, which is apparently Sony's vendor for repairing this model camera (and perhaps others). After I hadn't heard anything for about 3 weeks, I logged into Precision Camera's website and finally figured out the number they wanted me to enter (it was one of 2 long code/ tracking numbers supplied by Sony when I'd called them), and then was presented a message with no information except ""ON HOLD...Please call us at (800) 665-6515"". So I did...learning over the next week when I tried to call them every day or two that they NEVER answer the phone, and that no matter what option you select ""press 2 for customer service, press 3 to make a payment"" you are ALWAYS sent back to the original phone menu in an endless cycle, and that there is no way to leave a message. I finally called Sony again, explained my problem, and was given a different phone number to try. Leading to the same phone menu and ""loop"". Called Sony back, explained my problem again in a somewhat louder voice, and was ""escalated"", I guess they had a number for Precision which actually goes through. Finally got a call FROM Precision Camera the next day, no real apology for their phone system, and learned the problem was they wanted to charge me $305. for the repair which somehow they knew was was user-caused. I'm an honest guy, I know I dropped the camera, so I gave them a credit card number, so they could PROCEED with the repair which they had not done yet of course. No apology, just sort of ""we have a lot of cameras to work on"" for an answer. The camera did come back as promised about 8 days later in working order (note: they removed the Gariz leather cover I'd installed and did not return it, and also took off a stick-on UV filter, also not returned...take these off before sending in for repair. They did leave in place a glass LCD cover I'd installed).

Apparently Precision Camera will sit on your repair until you penetrate their phone system or speak firmly enough to the Sony rep with the heavy foreign accent to get some action from Sony to Precision Camera. Precision and Sony had my email address and phone number with the repair order but never tried to reach me.

This whole episode has me thinking Canon for the next pocket camera I buy. I know it's not a perfect world, but at least Canon fixed my S100 last year without all this runaround, in less than 2 weeks. Note to Sony: find another repair center or tell them to update their website or at least answer their phone in a timely fashion.

Original review: Really do like this camera as always-on-me alternative to my Nikon D610s. It does not compare to the Nikons in overall image quality of course, but really does a fantastic job in low light, excellent sharpness even wide open, and I have fun trying to push the envelope with it. The high-speed mode (good lord, 10 frames per second) increases the odds of getting a sharp image even at lower shutter speeds as you pan along with a subject. I never use the the flash, sure auto-ISO 4000 or 6400 is grainy but for those of us who remember pushing Tri-X to 1600, it's like a miracle taking photos of say a Christmas parade at night on a dark street...almost too dark to see yet the images look great and my friends on the floats were thrilled with them (no one mentioned grain, by the way.) My previous ""serious"" P&S was the Canon S100 but the Sony is really a step up from that (at a small cost in size). I also LOVE the viewfinder. My only negative comment is the stupid way Sony sells additional ""apps"" for example to do time-lapse photos...I paid for the app, jumped the hoops and downloaded and do use it, but it's like switching to a different interface when you want to ""load the app"" in the camera...would have been easy to include as a basic feature. While I'm at it, I wish they'd add filter threads so we could protect that front element without clunky add-ons by various manufacturers. Love the camera, but only 4 stars considering those last couple of issues. I picked mine up for just a little over $600.

Excellent value,"Expectation:
The camera should be compact so it can go anywhere, focus quickly, focus accurately, and take sharp/high quality photos that are rich in color. As an added bonus, it should take high quality video and do well in low light without a flash.

With that expectation in mind, the following pros and cons were found while shooting extra fine jpeg images and AVCHD 60p 28M(PS) videos.

Pros:
1) Compact enough to go everywhere.
2) Takes excellent photos in low light without a flash.
3) Takes beautiful macro shots that are rich in detail.
4) Focuses very quickly.
5) The background can be forced out-of-focus to create a professional looking effect.
6) Takes high quality video at 1080p.
7) Easily takes panoramic shots.
8) Zooming in and out is nearly silent.
9) The screen flips up for self-portraits.
10) The ""Fn"" button brings up a highly customizable quick menu.
11) Several buttons including the control ring can be customized.

Cons:
1) The ""Wide"" ""Focus Area"" setting frequently results in the image, especially the center, being out-of-focus. Half pressing the shutter button will correct the issue... sometimes.

2) ""Intelligent Auto"" shooting mode is not a dependable mode to leave the camera in.
a. It ALWAYS uses the ""Wide"" ""Focus Area"" in this mode (see con #1).
b. Scene recognition frequently selects the wrong scene. Taking an image of a car passing at 25 miles per hour results in a blurred streak.

3) When the ""Center"" ""Focus Area"" setting is selected, images still lack sharpness when compared to a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.

4) Colors are dull, especially when compared to images taken by a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.

5) Auto white balance (AWB) sometimes produces shots that are too warm.
a. If two shots are taken back-to-back sometimes one will be warm and the other accurate.

6) In a space the size of a living room, using a flash at distance frequently results in overexposure.

7) When shooting handheld, it's difficult to maintain the proper grip and use the control ring due to the size of the camera and lack of an actual grip.

8) The screen is cluttered with an excessive amount of icons that cannot be individually shown/hidden. Given that individual icon control is unavailable, the following seem like unnecessary icons for these reasons:
a. Infrequently changes: image ratio, number of megapixels, video format
b. Simply unneeded: SteadyShot

Summary:
There are several pros when it comes to the RX100 III but they seem to center around physical camera interaction and less frequent uses such as, low light and video. When it comes to daylight photos, which is a very frequent camera use, the bottom line is that pictures are not sharp enough or rich enough in color. Furthermore, you need to be ready to take a picture at a moment's notice and that requires a high quality and dependable automatic shooting mode that is lacking in this camera.",Helpful,5

Great Camera.,"I was excited when I bought the new Sony RX100M3 Camera brand new from Amazon about 3 months ago. I used it for a week on vacation and took about two thousand pictures. I have also used it for a couple day trips since then with no issue. I turned it on last week and to prepare it for my Christmas trip, format the SD cards, and set some of the presets. The camera powered on, the lens extended, but the rear screen would not display text or images. Also, all the buttons stopped working and it seemed to be stuck in movie mode, regardless of the dial settings, any button I pressed turned on and off record mode.

At that point, I checked Amazon online to see what the service policy was and where to go for support. Amazon's site said to contact the manufacturer for questions and/or repair, fair enough. So I called Sony support. The Sony tech asked me to try a couple things, power off and on, take the battery out, and finally said it sounded like a firmware issue and told me to send the camera back. He said that Sony would fix it under warranty.

I sent the camera in. A few days went by and Sony called me. They told me that the camera has some corrosion inside on the circuit boards, and said it was probably due to the humidity or moisture that may have entered the camera while in my use. I explained that I take very good care of tech gadgets and know for a fact that this camera was never exposed to any water or moisture. Apparently, corrosion is conveniently excluded from coverage under their warranty. Anyway, they told me that the repair of my camera is going to cost $225. I could either accept the fee or they would send the broken camera back to me. What was I going to do with an $800 paperweight and I really wanted this camera for Christmas photos. After trying to negotiate a more amicable solution, with no success, I agreed to the repair.

This was an $800, ""TOP OF THE LINE"" Sony camera (plus case, batteries, and other accessories) that I used for one trip, owned it for a total of 90 days, and now I have to spend another $225 to have it fixed. I checked online and found a lot of similar complaints about this corrosion issue with this camera and others are in same situation having to pay out of pocket for repair. In my opinion, here are the reasons this camera failed: inferior parts; poor construction; lack of quality control; and the body is not sealed from humidity. I have gone back and forth with Sony customer support and keep hearing, ""this is our policy"" and ""while we would like to help, there is nothing we can do"". I asked them to send me pictures of the corrosion, which I have not received. I can see me being charged if this was negligence on my part or if I had dropped the camera in the pool or ocean, but this camera has been dry since day 1. I don't expect every product to be perfect, if Sony would just acknowledged the camera was faulty and fix it under warranty, I would be happy.

I have several other cameras, Panasonic, Canon, and Nikon as well and iPhone, iPad, etc. Most are less expensive than the RX100M3 and some more than 10 years old. They are all still in top working condition, except for the Sony RX100M3.

Needless to say, I am very disappointed in Sony! The product quality and customer service are horrible! At one time, Sony was the go to company for high quality equipment and you didn't mind paying a little extra for it. It's just not that high quality company anymore. If Sony won’t stand behind the products they sell, who will?

There are far too many quality products on the market to waste your money on this overpriced junk. It takes great pictures and has lots of features, but in my opinion the costs are not worth the risks of getting one with a corrosion issue.

This will definitely be my last Sony product!",2,5

Handy camera. Better thought and set buttons for the requirement.,"I did hours and hours of research on pocket cameras that produce professional results. I did not want a run of the mill $250 point and shoot that takes garbage images. In this day and age, most smartphones can do the equivalent of a camera in that bracket.

I needed a camera to travel around Europe for a month. I shoot on a Canon 5D MK III when at home, but I was going to be very mobile on this trip. I wanted something small and high quality that would fit into the pocket of my khackis. I ended up sending this camera back (thanks to Amazon's great return policy) because it was not that great.

My main concern? The images were grainy and low resolution. I expected fireworks from a camera this expensive. I got iPhone quality results, and in fact I would prefer my iphone to this camera. I zoomed in on the RX100 shots in Photoshop and carefully examined them. They sucked. I was not impressed whatsoever. A $250 camera would have produced similar results. Or an iphone. The camera was promptly sent back.

The solution? You need a camera with a bigger sensor. This has a 1"" sensor which is crap. Go for an APS-C sensor camera because its a world of difference in terms of image quality and resolution.

The camera I settled on was the Fujifilm X70. The photo quality is light years ahead of the RX100 III. It's the same size, and currently comes in at a cheaper price.

Not impressed with this camera. Don't get sold by all the rave commentary, and hype. I only have to assume that anybody who raves about this camera does not have any appreciation for even basic photography. This camera just isn't there in terms of image quality. It produces crap.

I will also note that this camera has a pop up viewfinder, which feels very delicate, and like it may break. People think they need a viewfinder. Especially the die hard photographers. I find it ridiculous. You can frame a shot just as well by holding the camera at arms length and using the screen.

The zoom lens is also unnecessary. Zooming in on shots in a point and shoot is for amateurs. You just don't need it. You can always crop the shot later. Go with a fixed lens like the Fuji X70 that I just recommended. It makes like much simpler because you don't have to fiddle around with zooming. Most amateurs will abuse the zoom feature and zoom way too far in onto their subject and produce a lame image.

Update: I was referring to my iPhone 6. I'd rather walk around Europe snapping pictures with that than this nearly $1k waste of money.",Helpful,4

5 star,"I really wanted to love this camera but after shooting with it for about a month or so I'm profoundly disappointed. I've owned several Sony's over the years and this one is by far the worse. There are some nice features and the camera works in certain situations incredibly well (main advantage is that you can take really nice low light pictures) but beyond that not worth the price. By far the BIGGEST disappointment is the so called wifi connection. Using the amazingly over the top craptastically kludgy sony app, getting pictures to your phone or tablet is an exercise in dice rolling. It literally works 1 out of 5-10 tries. So frustrating. I've found the only way I can get it to work with my S4 is to delete and reinstall the app and reset the network settings on the camera. So basically something that was supposed to be significantly easier has turned into something significantly more difficult. I tried this on 2 different Samsungs (S4 and an S5) an iPhone 5 and an iPad 2 and iPad 3. So clearly the issue is with the camera and app not the devices themselves. Inquiries to Sony for help were fruitless. They offered no support or guidance whatsoever and emails went unanswered. Googling the problem indicates that it is widespread and a serious one. Bottom line: If you are thinking about this camera bc you take a bunch of low light pictures it might be worth it.If you are, on the other hand, buying this camera in order to get a good all rounder with wifi integration with your other devices don't bother.

"Good for beginners, very handy for outdoor","I changed my rating back to one star because I once again have problems with the manual setting. i have had two of these cameras. The first broke because I used it in the rain and didn't know about the corrosion problem. The second I bought a year ago, vowing to keep it out of the rain and any kind of hint of rain and humidity. I did that. After about six months, the manual setting feature stopped working. Sony helped me with that. Now it's out of warranty, and I can't use the manual setting because I can control the aperture. Don't buy this camera.

I had given this camera one star because the manual setting stopped working. I contact Sony support and got the message to initialize the camera. I did, and it worked. I now have a manual setting again. I like the camera a lot because it is small and the quality of the photos is good. I'm still looking for a compact with the highest quality photo possible, but that is probably a vain hope. Here are the directions I received. Try initializing the unit by going to MENU - SETUP - SETTING RESET - INITIALIZE. I did not like having to reset my cameral, however.

This is what I wrote for the one-star review. The rating is so low because the manual setting is a big reason I wanted the camera. I would give it five stars but I think Sony needs to fix the problem with not being able to use the camera in damp conditions.

I had this version of the RX 100M for about a month when the manual setting no longer worked. I could no longer focus the foreground and blur the background with the manual setting. I intended to ask for a new camera as it was under warranty. Unfortunately, I got involved with other parts of my life and forgot about the issue. I used the manual yesterday, and it still didn't work. I thought I would use the aperture setting, thinking I would get the foregrounding effect I wanted. Still didn't work. This camera is a huge disappointment.

This is my second RX 100M. I had the II version, but it stopped working in Ireland this summer (2015) when I used it in the rain. I liked the camera otherwise and decided to get the III. I have treated the III as if it were a newborn baby. The manual and aperture settings stopped working anyway. I don't recommend any version of this camera even though it's compact and the quality of the photos is good.

I've attached photos. The first is aperture at 1.8 and the other is a manual setting with aperture at 2.8 and shutter speed around 350. Terrible.",2,4

If you do want a DSC-60v make sure it has English on it's menu, since that camera is not available in the US. I bought one on the auction site that starts with an E, for well over half the price with English menu, NTSC and PAL video, and the app loaded. To me this cameras lens range was very limiting.

I did like the viewfinder on this one.",One,1

Perfect,"I bought the body and the 16-55mm 2.8 lens offline at a better deal. It was a tough decision choosing between this and other full frame options, but in the end I went for the option which will have me take more photos and pursue my interests in photography. I have been a fan of the Fuji designs and find it very easy to control the camera and use all its features to the fullest. Moreover, the full frame camera have lenses which are costlier and bulkier and it take the fun away from mirrorless shooting. Although, the T4 with 16-55mm is also on the heavier side but the lenses are cheaper than their counterparts for full frame.

The best thing I like about this camera is the design and the endless ways in which it can be customised. The AF is amazing with very easy controls through back button, joystick, and the option to use the touch screen to navigate focus points while you use the EVF is simply great. I also feel no other camera produces colors as good as Fuji. Much has been talked about its video capabilities, however, I am not much of a video shooter so won't write about it.

IBIS works great and I have used the camera handheld at 1/2 of a second at 55mm and was pleasantly surprised with the results. Weather proofing helps at extreme conditions. My T20 caught fungus in Mumbai's weather last year while I was away during the lockdown so the feature is certainly helpful. The battery backup is really good, although I hated when Fuji didn't include a charger with the body. I purchases the Fuji dual battery charger as I don't want to risk frying the camera in adverse scenarios by directly charging through it. I am not saying it will happen, but I am not willing to take the risk. The choice of quality crop lenses available is another great reason to go for the camera.

Overall it's a great camera with some really phenomenal capabilities. You get the IBIS which T3 lacked and weather sealing which the XH1 lacked. AF is great and the camera is fun to use. So buy it if you feel the camera will make you use it and become a better photographer.",8,5

I know it is not a full frame camera which for the price the XT4 is you probably should get an Alpha 7 II or some 6D Canon. But i do like the crispiness of the images and the overall quality. I got separately a 18-55 kit lens which fits perfectly for my needs for now.

Just not that unlike other brands the fuji gives you a full range of customisation of your settings with dials for basically anything. The screen is quite handy for taking awkward shots. All in all 5/5 for me.",4,5

Go for it,"Nette amélioration par rapport au XT-3, sans doute le meilleur boîtier APS-C",19,1
Good camera,,7,1
Best for photography,"Je suis un utilisateur intensif et de longue date (ancien photographe) de Canon en plein format en objectifs pro. Mon XT-3 était la solution au dos et aux épaules flingués après une longue journée, mais il m'énervait quand il insistait sur une valeur ISO stratosphérique pour une prise facilement gérée à 800 en plein format. Le boîtier souffrait également d'un peu de jeu sur la bague avec certains objectifs.
La stabilisation du capteur sur le XT-4 compense partiellement le problème de l'ISO. La qualité de construction est encore meilleure que le XT-3 (aussi bonne que sur le Canon 5D IV). La nouvelle batterie rattrape l'autonomie minable du XT-3, mais il faut en acheter au moins une de rechange quel que soit son appareil. Même les inconditionnels du RAW apprécient la qualité des jpg et les simulations Fuji. Par contre, optez pour Capture One si vous préférez photographier en RAW avec votre Fuji. Lightroom et Photoshop gèrent fort mal la démosaïcisation des capteurs X-trans, d'autant plus qu'on se trouve régulièrement dans des valeurs ISO élevées.
L’érgonomie du XT-4 est encore meilleure que sur le XT-3, et la personnalisation est facile et claire. Après une courte session de familiarisation on sait comment ajuster ses réglages tout en gardant le regard sur le sujet. Fini le temps perdu à fouiller dans les menus compliqués pour un réglage de base. Ça, c’est un appareil bien pensé, certainement par rapport aux horreurs des menus Sony et Olympus. Le côte ‘rétro’ des molettes de réglages (qui sont fermes, mais pas trop) amusera les photographes expérimentés et facilitera l’apprentissage des débutants. Je recommande cet appareil aux voyageurs, aux débutants qui veulent progresser et aux photographes amateurs exigeants. Oui, il s’adresse à un public aussi large…
L’autofocus Fuji n’est pas le meilleur de sa catégorie, mais il est tout à fait performant. N’étant pas vidéographe, je me contenterai de signaler les problèmes de réchauffement (partagés par tous les appareils) et de faire l’écho des commentaires comme quoi le XT-4 serait le meilleur APS-C à faire très bien ET photo ET vidéo.
Là où Fuji peine, c’est dans l’absence de bons flashes. La marque vient d’annoncer un nouveau (un réalité un flash tiers rebadgé en Fuji) à un prix trop élevé. Heureusement, Godox comble bien le déficit avec un excellent rapport prix-qualité. Dans le kit XT-3 il y avait un petit flash plutôt inutile ; dans l’offre boîtier nu XT-4 rien.
Un dernier mot sur les objectifs Fujifilm dont le kit 18-55 mm f2.8-f4 OIS est étonnamment performant. Si vos exigences dépassent les performances des premiers objectifs, vous allez vous retrouver acheter des produits certes moins chers que les cailloux pro de chez Sony, Canon ou Nikon, mais pas beaucoup plus petits ni plus légers.",5,1

Well, Fuji have cheaped out and make you buy a separate charger if, like me, you wish to continue using the camera while charging a battery. Also Fuji do not seem to be making a metal hand grip for the X-T4 as they do for other models, though there are third party grips. Finally, Fuji do not supply the little plastic gubbins with the X-T4 that they have always supplied with other cameras to help you open the strap split rings, I know this is nitpicking!

One Star,"Je travaille avec des boitiers Fuji depuis quelques années maintenant. X-T1, X-T2, X-H1, X-T3... et naturellement, j'ai voulu passé au X-T4.

Et pour la première fois, je n'ai pas vu l'upgrade.

3 raisons principales :

-> L'AF moins rapide que le X-T3 en AF-S (single).
En AF-C (continue), la différence est minime, mais en AF-S, c'est le jour et la nuit. Le X-T3 dans le domaine est une tuerie. Il fait la mise au point instantanément. Comme le font les OMD... Mais concernant le X-T4, il y a un léger temps de réaction (que je mets sur le dos du capteur à stabiliser) et surtout si on appuie d'un coup sec sur le déclencheur la photo sera le plus souvent prise sans que la mise au point soit terminée. Donc une photo légèrement floue à la clé. On observe le même type de mise au point molle sur les Sony A7III (appareil que j'ai revendu pour cette raison) ou la série des X100 (appareil que j'utilise abondamment ).

-> L'écran tactile sur rotule qui est moins pratique en photo que l'écran sur bascule.
Autant pour de la vidéo, c'est assez pratique dans certaines situations, autant en photo, le fait de basculer accélère significativement la réactivité en situations réelle...

-> L'autonomie devient excellente, uniquement quand on désactive le stabilisateur. Avec le stabilisateur, l'autonomie n'est pas significativement meilleure qu'avec un X-T3.
X-T4 (IBIS on) : 1400 photos avec une batterie
X-T3 : 1200 photos avec une batterie
X-T4 (IBIS off) : 2500 photos...

Bref, c'est un chouette appareil. Mais pas aussi réactif que son grand frère le X-T3, qui reste pour moi une référence.",18,1

More than value for money,"Ich habe mir die Kamera hauptsächlich zum filmen gekauft und bin beeindruckt, was in dieser Preisklasse möglich ist.

Was mir besonders an der Kamera gefällt, ist wie sie sich anfühlt. Sie sieht gut aus, ist nicht zu groß oder zu schwer, fühlt sich aber trotzdem stabil und hochwertig an - man hat sie einfach gerne in der Hand.

Der Autofokus ist schnell genug und zuverlässig, Augentracking etc. funktioniert sehr gut.

Das Menü ist einfach und übersichtlich aufgebaut und man hat die Möglichkeit sich Zebras, Gitterlinien, Wasserwaage etc einblenden zu lassen.

Aufnahmen sind mit bis zu 60fps in 4K/10bit möglich, 1080p/8bit sogar bis zu 240fps.

Der Bildstabilisator ist in Ordnung. Für meinen Geschmack war er teilweise zu wackelig, vorallem wenn man gegangen ist, sprang er manchmal hin und her. Die Bewegungen wurden stabilisiert, das Bild aber manchmal etwas verzogen.

Beim Color Grading habe ich bei stärkerer Bearbeitung vorallem in den Highlights relativ starkes Banding wahrnehmen können.

Zu den Fotos kann ich wenig sagen, da ich kaum welche gemacht habe.

Best budget tripod,"A powerful tool, but not for beginners, and expensive for APS-C",One,3
Good for indoor photography,"Have owned two Fuji cameras, this one and the X100F.
THE GOOD: This is a very powerful camera with a huge array of features. The shutter is exquisite, quiet and precise. The autofocus is exceptionally quick. It's got an array of tools and options in the menus that other big names don't have. It looks sharp. It's well built. The lens is metal and looks the business.
THE BAD:
1) The image quality was really not where I wanted it to be. I didn't think it was an improvement on my old Nikon D5500, when I opened the images up and zoomed in. It feels like a top-end full-frame mirrorless camera, with all the features you might expect, PLUS IBIS - that's for some reason hampered by that small APS-C sensor.
2) I wanted something more portable than my DLSR, but with the 16-80 zoom on it's not actually much smaller and only a few hundred grams lighter than a full-frame DSLR plus lens.
3) All those features add a fair amount of complexity, and it takes a lot of getting used to and menu-diving before it's where you want it to be.
4) I couldn't get the bridging app to work reliably, it was clunky and didn't want to play (this with a 2020 iPhone).
5) For £1800 it's an expensive proposition for an APS-C sensor, when there are many excellent full-frame options around that price, both DSLR and mirrorless.
I think Fuji's smaller rangefinders offer a lot of the functionality, style and charm – and the 'Fuji look' – for a lot less money. Something like this should be a big step up. It really didn't feel like it to me.
Your mileage may vary, and not everyone needs full frame. It's a nice piece, and it may work for you.",Helpful,3

Compre esta cámara hace unas semanas, pero por alguna razón el cargo llego completo a mi tarjeta en lugar de a meses. Llamé a Amazon y la única solución que me dieron fue devolver el artículo y esperar el reembolso, debido a que el cargo ya se había realizado en el banco. Esto me represento un problema porque implico quedarme sin mi herramienta de trabajo.
El proceso de devolución y la restauración de los fondos tardó varios días. Pero al quedar resuelto decidí comprar nuevamente la cámara.
Días después, llegó el paquete. Para mi sorpresa, resulto que era exactamente la misma cámara que yo había devuelto. A pesar de que yo había comprado una cámara nueva.
En cierta forma lo entiendo, ya que en ningún momento devolví el equipo por alguna falla.
Lo que si me parece una falta de respeto es que en ningún momento se me comentara que esto iba a suceder y si estaba de acuerdo con eso. Vaya, no sabía que esto era posible.
Me vi obligado a devolver el equipo, ya que me plantearon que no había otra opción.
Yo cumplí con los requerimientos que Amazon me pidió para hacer la devolución.
Y a final de cuentas, compre un equipo nuevo (porque en ningún momento de la segunda compra se me planteo que fuera usado) y termine con un equipo usado (aunque fuera por mi) pagándolo como nuevo.
No se si en algún momento de la segunda compra, el vendedor supo que era yo quien estaba haciendo la compra de nuevo. Pero no creo que eso sea correcto.
La primera compra debió finalizarse cuando se acepto la devolución de fondos. Y la segunda compra debió ser un proceso completamente diferente e independiente del primero.
Si yo hubiera esperado más tiempo o comprado la cámara con otro vendedor, hubiera terminado con una cámara nueva. Y entonces… ¿Le hubieran mandado esa cámara a alguien diferente?

Pro Tip - Get a 50 mm 1.8F canon prime lens for best potrait shots",One,5
Effective and Convenient,"Excellent VFM, especially if you are getting the dual kit version. I had a 1500D and was happy with it but gave it away as I needed one with Wifi/BT support.

Canon EOS 200D II is an excellent beginner's DSLR. It's a Canon, so there is absolutely no compromise in the quality. The kit lens 18-55mm is decent for regular snaps, and the 55-250mm Zoom Lens is excellent for long range shots. The OS is easy to understand and within a few hours/days you will be fairly comfortable with the DSLR and would love to snap away. Attaching some samples.

However, I would strongly encourage you to get Prime lens. Either EF 50mm f/1.8 (excellent VFM at ~8.9k INR) or EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens, and the 10-18mm wide angle lens.

Overall, Excellent APC-C DSLR which is VFM.",One,5
"Awesome Product and Support, Made in India Product","Perfect DSLR camera for beginners and enthusiasts. 24.1 mega pixel Sensor, Digic 8 processor with Dual pixel AF and vari-angle Touch screen definitely a big plus to this camera.

with a combination of point-and-shoot simplicity, a Guided UI (user interface) to walk new users through the basics of photography, and a Creative Assist mode for more adventurous photographic effects.

The vari-angle screen on the back is excellent. You switch to Live View by pressing a button on the back of the camera and you can then use the touch control to set the focus point and change camera settings. It's sharp, colourful and clear and the touch response is awesome. Apart from the mechanical noise when the mirror is flipped up to enter Live View mode, this is just like using a mirrorless camera, as the autofocus response is just as rapid.

One thing I Don't understand why Canon Stores images only 72DPI while Nikon stores at 300DPI? Can any one explain this?

4K video is a big selling point on this camera, but you do notice a couple of limitations , there's a significant 'crop factor' in 4K mode, which means your lens's angle of view effectively becomes narrower. Any how, I am not much using videos.

Battery life is good and last for longer period.

Good,"Beyond the digic 8 hype, the dual pixel cam and a touch screen lcd, the pics are not that great.
My galaxy s9 plus shot better pics, atleast for me.
The camera cant be returned and only replaced that too only in case of a flaw.
The 18-55mm lens sucks and maybe 50mm stm prime lens is way better.
The flash is a manual lift up and not a automatic pop up which is big drawback.

It’s not a good choice if you want value for money. If anything it’s a better studio camera for videos. Go for Nikon if you’re into sports, it’s THAT simple.

La otra tiene que ver con el cambio de imagen automático. Esto está bien, pero estaría mejor como opción, porque a veces quiero encender algo pero no cambiar la imagen. Un ejemplo perfecto es el caso de la Nintendo Switch. Si metes la consola en el dock, aun estando apagada, el conmutador lo pilla y cambia la imagen, todo para mostrar una pantalla negra durante 10 segundos y luego volver a donde estaba antes.

"Adding a webcam, mic & USB 4 support will put it at next level","1) Le changement automatique de source HDMI quand la source active s'éteint est perturbé par le comportement de mon téléviseur Samsung qui se branche alors sur la réception TNT; je ne me retrouve donc pas automatiquement sur l'autre source HDMI allumée comme espéré (il me faut agir ensuite en actionnant une touche ""HDMI"" de la télécommande de la télévision que par ailleurs j'utilise peu car mon fire TV stick, source HDMI principale, commande bien la télévision (un peu trop d'ailleurs pour ce sélecteur car éteindre le stick éteint également la télévision, ce qui est pratique pour l'utilisation d'une seule source HDMI mais pas pour celle de plusieurs sources).
2) Le changement manuel marche bien mais n'est pas pratique:
- d'une part parce que le bouton à actionner correspondant est tout petit,
- d'autre part parce que le câble HDMI en sortie du sélecteur est très petit et, étant intégré ne peut pas être remplacé. Le sélecteur se retrouve donc en général presque obligatoirement derrière la télévision ou du moins à un endroit très peu accessible ou pas forcément assez accessible pour faciliter suffisamment une éventuelle intervention manuelle.
Je testais le sélecteur surtout pour une utilisation potentielle sur un autre téléviseur plus ancien (d'un parent) d'un comportement différent sans doute dans le cadre d'une sélection automatique mais la sélection manuelle de secours du selecteur étant peu pratique ....

Pour ce parent mon but est de doubler le plus simplement possible l'utilisation d'un boitier TV mini de SFR, pas assez fiable à l'usage selon mon expérience personnelle, par celle d'un boîtier Connect TV prévu pour le moment en secours (android TV avec application SFR qui permet de retrouver toutes les chaînes de l'abonnement).

Okay with a couple of issues,"One needs atleast 3MP camera for outdoor as it needs to capture greater details. I have tried other cameras and while resolution was one issue, colour reproduction was another. This camera reproduces colours as you see with your naked eyes!
Camera build quality is good for outdoors. The Tapo app is good too with good many options like motion alert, area intrusion alert, line crossing alerts and so on. You can choose between continuous recording to alert recordings. The app has profile like feature which applies different settings mentioned above when you are at home and while away from home. Like you can set to record on alert while at home and choose to record continuously when away.

As received with any product this has its flaws too. The alerts detection is flawed so leaves movement, insects 🐞🦗🪰or spider web 🕸️🕷️ that overtime built around this camera gets picked up alerts! Many cameras advertise about human detection as feature however TP-Link provides this as premium feature ie you need to subscribe to their cloud storage feature (costs ₹300/ month or ₹3k /annum). This feature is available for free for limited time.

The device connects on 2.4GHz wifi and has LAN option too. If one has reliable wifi router and connection, this is good enough. Connection setup is simple and intuitive. As said app has good GUI and show to support 32 camera devices on this app. One can LIVE view upto 4 cameras in one go.

I shall add more as I experience this camera little more.

Overall it's a good buy",5,3
This comes with 16A power plug!,"I have tried this with 2 different setup ( 2 different routers, one with internet and another one without internet)
Conclusion -

App is excellent, lot of features, alarm sounds is very loud, it perfect security device for someone. Body of camera etc is very good and looks reliable for long term outdoor use, However not tested it under direct sunlight and long term, but they claim its outdoor so it must be work fine under direct sunlight and rough hot weather, and comes with warranty I don't think I need to worry about that.

However, just wanted users to know this.
If you are using router which has internet connection(for ex- broadband) it works like a charm. App is lite and smooth. Very impressed with app features and user friendly design. Great for first time buyers like me. I was able to setup entire camera within less than 3 mins literally. I thought it would be hassle to setup for first time users but it went through all setup steps within 3mins, and boom! It i was live. However it connect with Wired connection and was unable to detect my wireless connection (requires 2.4g wifi) but for some unknown reason it was not connecting which I'm still working on, I checked all parameters into my wifi router but could not figure out the problem. Still working on it.

then I tried 2nd setup, connecting it to router which does not have internet connection but wifi is working and my phone is connected to same router which camera is connected using RJ45 wired connection, but it could not detect the camera at all! I did little research all i could find people saying it will not work on wifi router without internet connection, I'm sitting at home, my phone is connected to wifi router and camera to same router without internet but it will not detect the camera in the app.

So overall make sure you have internet connection in your wifi router to see real time image, otherwise it may not work! you cannot use wifi connection to check or add your device even if you are sitting in range within your home.",3,3
Works great. Less one star as the colour needs to be calibrated.,I bought 4mp camera variant. Image quality is average and suitable only for distance of 10 feet. Motion detection is awesome and we need 16gb storage to store for one complete day without audio. All image & video are stored in camera and We can't access camera video without internet as expected. We need to buy cloud storage for complete access of offline video which would cost 300rs per month. Overall features are good but I expected much more image clarity and that was disappointing. We can't clearly identify face but with approx guess can identify the person. That's a bad thing for security camera.,4,3
Value monitor,"I have been using this cameras for about a month now and here are my take away-
1. Camera quality is good. Both daylight and night time recording are clear.
2. Storage can be expandable upto 128gb which is quite respectable.
3. Working on Wifi network is good.
4. IP66 certification.
5. Tapo care is a subscription which is unnecessary and can be avoided.
6. Software update is a little inconsistent. I bought 2 cameras one got updated last week and another one still not which is weird.
7. AI detection works like a charm.

Disappointed with the reviews and the product,"It’s a good product but not the best. Have all the necessary features with good picture and recording clarity. The app is smooth and easy to use. Motion tracking is good but person detection is not that optimised.

Only problem is that despite of defining the activity zone, the camera still sounds an alarm if anyone is detected outside the activity zone. I hope the company would work on this issue.",3,3
Terrible after sales service in Chennai,"The product is really good, but bad service. The product description says it supports both Alexa and Google devices, but it doesn't.

I reached out to customer care and they keep arguing it still support. Finally I sent screenshot that clearly shows the camera doesn't support Alexa. The customer care then asked Tapo technical team seeking clarification. It has been 6 weeks now... no response yet. Tapo customer care is still chasing Tapo technical team..good luck..

So please don't ever trust what is given in the product description",One,3

Good Build quality.
Easy to install. No need of installation specialist.
Excellent reliable App works well on both iPhone & Android.
Very good motion detection recording helps to save storage space.
Good wide angle lenses which cover more area.

Cons:
Average image quality.
No noticeable difference in Full HD and 3MP resolution settings.
No way to change the image quality - bit rate.
It looks highly compressed low bit rate recording.

Conclusion:
If you want a modern Wi-Fi cctv camera with easy to install and ok with average picture quality, this is the best option.

If you want a cctv camera which helps to investigate the passing vehicle number plates, an unknown person face crossing the area, then avoid this camera and look for something else.",3,2

Le seul problème c’est la nuit, un petit peu de crachin, ou même du brouillard, un moucheron, bref tout ce qui passe devant, elle se déclenche et m’envoie une notification, même en réglant la sensibilité de détection au minimum ……
du coup toutes les 30 secondes, notification sur le téléphone.
Ce qui fait que dès que le jour se couche, je suis obligé de désactiver la caméra…
Vachement utile pour une surveillance de nuit……..
Je suis bien conscient que la caméra ne coute pas chère et que l’on ne doit pas avoir les mêmes attentes qu’un modèle 3 ou 4 fois plus chère…., mais là franchement, ne pas pouvoir laisser une caméra de surveillance en marche parce qu’elle détecte ne serait-ce que le brouillard, ou oui le brouillard, ou un minuscule moucheron qui passe devant, c’est quand même bien dommage.

En mi más humilde opinión quiero decirles que los sensores que están insertando a esta nueva gama de Reflex D7200 y D7500 no son del todo agradables, las fotografías tienen otra textura, menos originales, poco nítidas; como diría mi papá, parece que los monos están hechos de plastilina. Quizás nikon a tratado de igualar a canon en el tipo de sensor que usa para sus cámaras pero la verdad a mi me gusta más el tipo de fotografía que obtienes con cámaras de la gama D5000... hasta la D7100.

Otra cosa, no me gusto para nada que la D7500 tengo solo una ranura para SD, acostumbro a siempre guardar la información en dos SD por seguridad y con esta cámara no podre hacerlo, corro en un gran riesgo trabajar un evento social con ella pensando que pueda suceder algo malo con mi información.

Initially i thought it’s very great upgrade as There are very good reviews on D7500 every where and I like the dark colors of blue sky’s and green backgrounds with Nikon. but it’s image stabilization and auto focus and ISO are not even comparable with entry level canon DSLR. I am not able to take same pictures with same quality with my hand. I use 18-140 DX lens. I spent $1550 on this D7500 I am regretting now. If you are canon user better don’t switch to Nikon.

Its the best budgeted 4k Monitor,"Very pleased with this having upgraded from a 5D Mark II. I was originally keen to upgrade to the Mark III when it came out but was put off by the initial negative reviews and the increased launch cost, only to see its reputation grow considerably in the time it was available making me regret my decision. The Mark IV again is not seen as revolutionary enough in some quarters – exactly as the Mark III was initially – but it substantially different to the Mark II and I decided it was time to ignore the nay-sayers and give it a go.

And my first impression? I have been really stunned by the performance and changes since the Mark II and a weekend with it has shown me what a considerable upgrade it is – albeit quite complex in comparison.

I probably shot around 70,000 frames on the Mark II covering wildlife, landscapes, weddings, astrophotography, timelapse and travel so I consider myself pretty familiar with the platform. However, the Mark IV is considerably more advanced and therefore has MANY more options. Consequently it has taken quite a bit of learning (and fun) experimenting with all the new options to see how it works. The manual is 700 pages! But I was still able to pick it up without any of this and see how much of an advance it is.

Favourite changes compared to the Mark II
1) Autofocus – stunningly fast through the viewfinder. Hugely better than the Mark II. Nice to be able to select zones to focus with as well as just points.
2) Autofocus (live view) – I never used this before because it was so bad, but now it is stunning. I can even accurately focus an F11 combo (2x extender and F5.6 lens), something not possible through the viewfinder – even on the Mark IV which will only focus an F8 combo.
3) Drive. The speed of the drive is incredible compared to the Mark II (more than twice as fast). It is also nice to now have a silent shutter option at about half the noise level.
4) Wi-fi. This is really fantastic, simply because I can get images of the camera so quickly. From taking a personal photo to sharing it from my phone takes less than a minute. Previously this would take 10-15 minutes by the time I had started the computer and Lightroom and imported the photo. Makes me more likely to use it for personal use rather than just serious photography.
5) Resolution. The 50% bump in resolution is really noticeable. I can zoom in considerably more and the options for cropping are obviously much better. I also don’t seem to have any issue so far with soft images which people have said happens with high resolution sensors although I have only used L series lenses.
6) ISO. It is great to have auto ISO with programmable limits now compared to the 5D II but I have been really impressed at how far I can push it. 12800 was something I wouldn’t even consider going near with the Mark II but now the quality of this has really blown me away. More like an ISO 3200 image on the Mark II, maybe even better.
7) Ergonomics. There are more physical buttons on the Mark IV which, although I am learning, are clearly going to be useful for switching settings even more rapidly. The rating button was on the Mark III, but for me coming from the Mark II, this is a very welcome making sorting the images in the field much easier.
8) Batteries and cards. The Mark II battery still works in this (the LP-E6N has slightly more capacity but is otherwise identical) and of course the Compact Flash is still accepted. I would have liked a newer format option but for now this works well for me. Writing images from buffer seems plenty quick enough.
9) Timelapse. I do a lot of this and whilst I like my programmable external controller it looks to have enough features to make it practical to use the built in intervalometer instead.
10) Touchscreen. This is actually really useful, especially when focusing in live view, zooming images, or swiping through them – just as responsive as a good smartphone. I am finding I am using the camera in a different way like selecting focus for a video or picture on the back (it feels like I am chimping a LOT) but the focus is so darn good it seems a shame not to!

Things I need to get used to
1) Battery life. I have been playing around a lot and GPS/Wi-fi have been left on for now, but it drops much more quickly than the Mark II.
2) Awkward ergonomics using touchscreen. Because your right hand grips the camera you need to loosen that to pinch zoom in/out. I have almost dropped the camera several times doing this. I guess the only option is to learn to pinch zoom with my left hand only or always use the strap!
3) Complexity. The camera has an order of magnitude more options than the Mark II. It has only been one weekend and I need to spend more time getting to know the camera but some bits I will probably never understand. This is probably less of an issue if your are coming from a Mark III.
4) Dual Pixel RAW. I have yet to try Dual Pixel images as reviews suggested the effect was so negligible I haven’t yet tried.

Lightroom now supports the 5D Mark IV and the photos attached are just using the default settings in Lightroom (no extra sharpening etc). As you can see the full frame image is of a sunflower with a bee on it. I have included a 100% crop of this to show that the sensor has picked up even the individual hairs on the back of the bee despite it being tiny in the frame. This was handheld at 1/200s on a 24-105mm L lens set at 105mm.

I have also included a night time shot of the Milky Way @12800 ISO, 20s, F4 24-105mm L. I have included a 100% crop of this too. The movement of the stars is caused by the 20 second exposure time but you can see quite a bit of noise in the church. However, considering this is 12800 ISO I am still very impressed.

In summary I am really pleased I have made the change. I was concerned that the benefit wasn’t going to be enough to justify the cost to swap but I now think it is well worth it.",2,4

Value for money.,"I have owned every A7r camera including the original, A7rii, A7riii, and now the A7riv. The A7riv is the first big image quality improvement in years! Is it worth it to upgrade to 60MP? Definitely but be aware that this still a specialized camera and not an action camera.

The camera industry remained stead at the 24MP range for years now. In the past year the Canon R5 and R6 cameras have pushed the envelope and the new megapixel race is back in full swing. Usually high megapixel wars were more about bragging rights and marketing than actual usability. Noise and image quality decreases with higher resolutions due to smaller physical pixels. This remains true with the A7riv's 60MP sensor over the A7riii's 42MP. However the increased resolution minimalizes the perceivable noise increase (You won't see it unless you pixel peep). In addition, the higher resolution helps with sharpness, contrast, and cropping flexibility across the board and you get an overall better camera.

The Good:

Image Quality. As mentioned above 60MP improves sharpness and cropping flexibility. There is some degradation of dynamic range and noisier ISOs. But again, since the resolution is much finer, the small amounts of noise introduced is much less noticeable at these resolutions. When used with uncompressed RAW (see below) you get much better ISO and dynamic range.

Cropping. I cannot emphasize the ability to crop with 60MP. The larger megapixel count gives greater range of flexibility to crop, refocus, and recompose photos in post. Often I change the entire composition of a photo with extreme cropping of my A7riv files. You can change full body portraits into headshots and retain excellent sharpness. Reframe centered subjects to align with rule of thirds or vice versa. The ability recompose shots afterwards is amazing!

Autofocus. The A7riv has a significantly improved AF that covers much more of the sensor than the A7riii. The A7riii just added a few more contrast detection points over the A7rii but the A7riv has PDAF points nearly covering the entire sensor. With my A7riii it was very difficult to eye-AF on subjects on the corners of the sensor. With the A7riv, unless your subject is on the very edge of the sensor, you will have full AF functionality including eye-AF. Furthermore the AF is much snappier and eye-AF finds the eye faster and stays locked on in dimmer conditions and further away than the A7riii.

Battery. The camera still uses the newer Z batteries that comes with the newer generation of Sony cameras. The Z Batteries have doubled life over the older W batteries. Getting such a long runtime with such a high MP camera is pretty great.

IBIS stabilization. Sony was one of the first large companies to use IBIS in full frame cameras. 5.5 stops of stabilization is amazing and still makes handheld slow light photos seem like they were on a tripod. I am still amazed by this feature sometimes. Tests do show that in real world tests the A7riv has slightly better IBIS stabilization than the A7riii.

Ergonomics/usability: Not much has changed over the A7riii. Every year, each new version of the camera is bigger, thicker, and heavier. The joystick feels nicer and the shape is more comfortable. The camera itself is slightly thicker which is better to hold for your hands. There are no glaring issues here.

The bad:

Dynamic Range. Dynamic range is on par with other cameras of this generation. However shadow recovery is slightly worse than the A7riii. This is mainly due to the use of Compressed RAW setting with continuous shooting. When using Compressed Raw and continuous/burst mode, the camera shoots at 12-bit instead of 14 bit. If you shoot in single shots with uncompressed RAW you can get much better dynamic range and shadow recovery. 60Mp files are huge and not easy to process and this camera is NOT an action camera. But the fact that you can get 10fps with a 60mp camera even at 12-bit is still pretty amazing.

Processing speed: With 60MP, writing to SD cards is even slower than before. As previously mentioned you can improve image quality by using uncompressed raw which DOUBLES file sizes from around 59mb to around 117mb. This makes writing to a regular 90/95mb/s USH-I card EVEN SLOWER. You can't review images after each shot without waiting for the writing to clear. With continuous multiple shots it takes EVEN SLOWER! You can help alleviate this problem with faster UHS-II 300mb/s cards but at the time of this review these cards are RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. Sony really needs to implement compressed lossless RAW files as 60MP is nearing the limit and resolution will continue to creep up.

Speed. This is not an action or sports camera, but it CAN handle some action at 10fps. As mentioned previously, shooting in burst and continuous does reduce quality a bit. If you are a wedding photographer or lifestyle/street photographer this will be fine for your needs. However if you are shooting sports, dance, motion, a dedicated action sports camera that can handle the speed without quality loss like the A1 or A9 would be better suited for you.

Pixel shift. Pixel shift is a great feature on paper. The sensor shifts very slightly letting you get significantly better quality images by using quadrupling the color information in each pixel. However realistically you can't use it without some smearing or ghosting. Unless you are using it for perfectly static scenes you will get some sort of smearing. Wind moving tree leaves or grass, moving cars in cityscapes, any movement will throw off the sensor. I have never meaningfully used this feature. Additionally you need Sony's Edge software to compile the images which just adds to the processing steps.

This is a great camera and a phenomenal upgrade. It does however have some limitations. For years the A7r series was the flagship camera of Sony's line. However we must remember this is really geared for landscapes and studio work were lighting conditions are controlled and you don't need to shoot fast action. Sony has diversified with the A9 and A1 line with the A9 being sports and the A1 being the dedicated all-around flagship camera with little compromises. For your everyday photographer who is not shooting ballet dancers or basketball games regularly, this should be perfectly suitable for their needs. Even professional wedding and street photographers will find little to complain about. Only the most demanding action photographers pushing the limits will want more.",2,4

Could have been little cheaper,"The A7R4 isn't for everyone, but if your niche meets the needs of high resolution and mirrorless performance, it is fantastic.

Combined with the Sony 90mm Macro I can attain tac sharp focus handheld on insect eyes. I can shoot tiny jumping spiders, assassin bugs, flowers, lichen, moss, and all kinds of incredibly tiny subjects. APSC mode (or crop in Lightroom) makes this both the highest resolution Full Frame as well as a phenomenal Crop Sensor camera. Win win!

Combined with Sony 24-70 F2.8 GM, I can shoot all of my day-to-day non-macro photos. Things like street photography, infant photography, family photos, and more.

If dual memory card slots is critical to you, then this is a feature you need and will love. Most mirrorless cameras (ie Nikon) are a dang joke! So sad! Seriously, if you don't have dual cards in the camera then it is just a toy, not a tool. Professionals can't risk loosing photos.

File size is huge, managing space might be hard, a fast computer will help in processing and managing your files. Google drive doesn't support Sony RAW files, so I also save jpg versions for quick viewing. More space gone... more upload time required.

The app is actually really great for a newer app. Connecting works all the time, but only if you do things in a particular order. They should fix that... I can control my exposure triangle from the app, shoot, and review a low resolution sample. Great for a remote shutter. Doesnt let me touch to focus... would love remote focus with focus magnifier. Would die for the same with a focus stacking mode from the app. I might be a dreamer though, probably won't ever see this.

Ok, and the back screen. Seriously Sony?! Still poor resolution, but the biggest sin is that the screen still doesn't flip around like canon cameras! Holy smokes, catch a clue Sony! Vloggers are a huge deal, stop ignoring them! At least the app can give you a remote live view experience on your cell phone. So that seems to be a workaround for me. But I can see that not working well for people that blog a lot.

Most people could do well with an A7R3 instead. Could you benefit from the savings? Could you use that for more accessories or glass? Would that help you more than the resolution jump? Maybe!

For macro, the super high resolution is really a big help. Know your needs!

Hope this helps you decide on your next camera! I love my Sony A7R4!",36,3

Good Product,"The auto focus is the best I've ever used. I've not used the A9 II but easily better than the 1DX II or D5. Shocked at how good the AF was in all cases. The picture quality is a different story not impressed at all. At 1 to 1 it doesn't compare to a GFX 100 or even GFX 50 for that matter. It's saving grace is you can apply heavy amounts of noise reduction and it will still be pretty detailed for web use. If you're buying this and thinking you're going getting amazing image quality I'd say look elsewhere. The A7R III, D850, Panasonic S1R, all make nicer images. Any detail gains are not worth the overall reduction in image quality, mainly unpleasant noise. It may not have helped that lately I've also been using the X-T3 and while not as detailed the colors are amazing as soon as I open the raws in Capture One. The A7R IV files not so much. Specifically when you have shots from same shoot on different cameras and can compare the images side by side. Wish the A7III or A7R III had the focusing system of the A7R IV. That is really the special feature that sets this camera apart, not the 60 megapixels or the image quality. If you're looking ultimate image quality you will still have to pony up for Phase One, Hassy, or Fujifilm GFX.",Helpful,3

Not an eye friednly display. (Update) It will be if you scale windows to 125%,"I have had all 4 generations of the A7R cameras.
I loved the A7R II for the amazing sensor vast improvement on autofocus and play memories app. But I was frustrated with battery life.
The A7R III corrected the battery life with a huge leap forward in Stamina. The new battery is still the best in mirrorless cameras. The 3rd generation also improved ergonomics, button placement, etc while using the same sensor as the previous generation. The A7R III is an amazing camera and truly refined. The only thing negative was slow sensor readout that resulted in banding when using silent shooting or electronic shutter. You could also see it in videos. But this sensor was still better than anything out there.

Unfortunately Sony decided to participate or precipitate the megapixel war for the 4th generation (A7R IV).
This means compromising in terms of noise, iso sensitivity and slower sensor readout. The A7R IV sensor readout is 50% slower than the A7R III and has more noise than that of the A7R III at similar iso.

But they did refine the body by changing the buttons size, putting a much needed lock on the aperture compensation and increasing the grip.
Here’s my opinion on the changes to the body:
1. I actually prefer the grip of the A7R III but in time I am sure I will adjust to the new one.
2. The buttons while larger, feel mushy when pressing it. This is a step backwards.
3. I really like the lock on the exposure compensation dial, as I would inadvertently turn the dial on the A7R III.
4. I prefer the lock mechanism of the older memory door, but the new one seems more weather sealed.
5. I prefer the new port doors to the older one.
6. I am hoping that there is really improved weather sealing here. Photography is not just a fair weather art.

Other features:
1. Same old video codec and still only 8 bit. But I like that the recording time limit is removed. So a positive.
2. Improved menu options (autofocus color options, other customization)
3. Supposed to have real time tracking. But I noticed the my A7R III was faster and a bit more accurate overall. Hopefully future firmware will improve it.
4. I have to admit that the 50% increase in resolution does give incredible detail. But this comes with a greater possibility of blur. You have to be extremely careful with your shutter speeds and techniques to prevent shutter shock.
5. Unfortunately Sony has been extremely short sighted when designing a high megapixel sensor, by not programming in lossless compressed raw files. In addition smaller raw files with lower resolution are not options. This actually makes me feel that this camera was a rush to market to demonstrate technological capabilities.
6. They have not fixed or improved the speed of the buffer writing to the sd cards. Another callous decision considering the amount of data needed to be written with 61MP. This makes the camera unusable when writing from buffer same as in the Mark III.

I think Sony missed out on refining the camera and making it a big leap forward.
So, why did I buy this camera? I actually purchased it to augment my A7R III and not replace it, for the following features:
1. No more recording limit on 4K, so I can record long classical concerts.
2. New digital interface for audio
3. Possibility of using the SAL 135mm 1.8 A-mount lens with this camera, using the soon to be released LA-EA5 adapter. This is my favorite lens and I prefer it to the e-mount GM lens. This was the biggest reason I bought this camera.
4. Price: Sony reduced the price by $500 for the amazon prime day sale.

So, in the week I have had it, I can say it is a solid camera.
I hope Sony will make improvements with firmware as they did with the Mark III.
I feel that this is much more of a specialist camera than the A7R III due to the big increase in resolution.
If you are looking for a better all round camera with high resolution, I would go for the A7R III.

For those that want an excellent all round camera, the A7 III is still the one to beat. I hope that Sony takes a lot more care when designing its successor (A7 IV).

Note: I did find the perfect Arca Swiss plate for this camera and all the other A9, A9 II, A7R III, A7 III, etc - the Arca-Swiss 802225. It’s a little pricy, but let’s you clamp the camera on its horizontal axis, thus letting you use larger adapters, lenses, etc without any obstruction. It’s also designed to not twist.
I use it on all my Sony cameras.

Don't Buy This - Design Flaw,Complicated,656,1
Beautiful va monitor with worst backlight bleeding in market.,"Ok so after a few days upgrading from my good old Canon 6d, here are a few cons :

Noise :
- noisier than A7R3 and A73 so not great for taking pictures of my kids inside with only ambient lightning
- A7R4 is about 1/3 stop noisier than A7R3 which means, to have as little noise, you need to let enter 1/3 stop more light
- which means you need to lower your shutter speed (or increase aperture) by 1/3 stop, for example from f/250 to f/160, which means you will have more difficulty freezing action so your image have chances to be blurrier

File size :
- uncompressed raw files are huge (120mb)
- there is no lossless raw compression
- you will a fast computer ($$) and a lot of SSD space to process these files
- you will need large fast SD cards (UHS-II, U3, at least 256GB) that are expensive ($$)
- even Sony SF-M sd card is relatively slow and won't allow me to quickly see my photos to review focus for example, I have to wait for the buffer to clear, else it's laggy, which is quite annoying, I will have to try Sony SF-G
- Canon r5, Sony a7rIII, a7s3 files are much smaller so they are faster to process, think about it since your time is valuable

Complexity :
- not much is simple with this camera
- menus could be worst but they are not user friendly at all
- a ""slow"" SD card makes shooting in continuous mode quite annoying/odd/slow, Sony should warn the user
- no scene selection mode like on my Canon 6D for people that want or need simplicity (I don't trust full auto mode)
- saved settings for memory recalls can't be renamed to meaningful description
- touch tracking not enabled by default
- limited touch screen functionalities (only useful to set tracking point basically)
- enabling Preview makes Continuous Mode atrocious because the Preview also appears in the Viewfinder
- to zoom a Sony lens, it's the inverse direction than on the Canon (might be Canon's fault)
- would be nice if Sony gave recommended settings (some kind of pre-sets/suggestions for Custom Keys/Buttons and My Menu Favorites)
- no automatic focus bracketing
- PlayMemories software keeps creating .modd files and importing my PC pictures in its library even if I unselected all folders from being imported.

I tried the feature ""View on TV"", I get ""could not authenticate the connection"" on the camera and Registration failed on my sony TV (xbr 65x900e). I tried multiple times. Then I tried connecting by entering the password, I got ""could not find the access point"".

Then I tried the new app for ios devices called Visual Story. First, why not on android ? This is not very respectful of android users. Second, it was not available in Canada. Third, (once I changed my country in apple store) the process to set it up is a mess, the ipad does not see the camera when trying to connect via bluetooth to set up the FTP and I tried with multiple ipads.

Update after a few months : I got used to its many flaws and I was able to get good results without too much trouble. But this does not make it a better product. Another missing opportunity : there is no way to see the focus points using Sony Imaging Edge. Let's say you want to check where your focus was to better understand the end result. Finally, for video, the image stabilization is disappointing. My phone and my gopro are miles better and both are less expensive. Now Sony released the A1, double the price of the R4 and they have not updated the firmware on the R4 since over 6 months, pretty disappointing, not sure I will buy another camera from Sony because I don't want to encourage Sony to release more expensive products instead of improving flawed products already released.

Any pros ? Ok cropping when you have images of that size/resolution is pretty insane (as long as you have low iso and no motion blur), dual slot is always good to have, dynamic range is good, battery life is ok and it survived to Canadian winters.",434,1
Nice bright screen but no adjustment to screen angle,Report abuse,314,1
"Monitor has curve, strong backlight, but not ideal for gaming",Unexpected Surprise,34,1
Curve has no use at all,"Th ergonomics of this camera compared to the previous 7r models are very user friendly. The increased backbutton size, the larger grip and just the way the camera feels in your hand are welcomed improvements. The fast focus, focus tracking and focus point color are also worthy of praise. However, the need for Gmaster lenses to really see a difference in image quality were not apparent to me before I purchased the A7riv. Spending $3500 for the same picture quality as a 7riii with the same lenses for $1000+ less makes little sense unless you are willing to spend $1500 to $2500 for premium glass. Also unless you have the need to print huge sized images, why do you need 60 megapixels of resolution. In fact uncompressed images are over 120Mb and will eat up most hard drives. 42 megapixels of resolution produces incredible sharpness with almost all Sony native glass including Tamron and Sigma Art (Sony) lenses. and if you shoot 10 frames per second you have to wait for buffer to slowly clear before you can change any settings, maybe resulting in lost shots. If you are a professional photographer (I doubt any will read reviews on Amazon) and you need larger prints than say 30x40, what is the point of higher resolution sensors? I have been shooting with a A7riii for a couple of days after returning my IV and I am amazed at the quality of the images I am getting with a Sony 24-105 f4, a Tamrom 17-28 and a Sony 50 f1.8. Spend the extra money if you feel the need, but I doubt you will see any improvement for general photography. Save the $1000 and buy more lenses for your A7riii which I highly suggest you try before considering the A7riv.",23,1

Awesome product in this price range,"Hi Everyone,

So I am having this tripod for around 2 weeks and have used it for testing and all and here are my findings.

Let's talk about the pros and cons.

Pros
1. Robust build looking at the price and can handle all mobile phones using the mobile holder and some low weight DSLR and mirrorless. I have used canon M50 and it handled it well as there was no wobble in tripod also pan and tilt were fine and will serve the purpose.
2. it is made of aluminium so it handles weight perfectly and only lever locks are made of plastic which is easy to open and close.
3. It can go as low as 35cm and high as 140cm when fully extended which is good, but I would have highly appreciated if it would have gone 160 or above.
4. It also has a bubble indicator which helps to level the tripod.
5. The pan and tilt are smooth so it could be helpful for smooth and eye-catching B-rolls.
6. It is lightweight and comes with carrying case which is cherry on the top.
7. It requires little caring as it is not rugged so if you are harsh user then it will not last long in your hand.

Cons.
1. Everything is good considering the price, the only problem I felt is that the mobile holder is not sturdy enough and it will give shaky videos if you are carrying the tripod and moving, It would be recommended to buy a mobile holder which will cost you around 150 and would be great, apart from that i did not find NY other cons and by the way it works great with the DSLR and mirrorless, so if you own one and don't want to spend a lot on tripod and need a basic one for still and videos then this is really a good choice.

Highly recommend looking at the price, If you can spend more definitely there are some better choices for around 1500.",16,4
Very nice monitor at around 15k rs," I tried 2 other cheap tripods but at 750₹ this turned out to be such an amazing tripod.

Small footprint and good carry bag.

It's sturdy & I am not scared to put my costly phone on it.

So much control with the knobs.

Height little low at 4ft 2 inches but ok for my casual use.

Good quality mobile holder comes with it.

Comes from a genuine seller as it has a warranty card and instructions to register product on seller's website. It is coming with 1 year warranty.

It comes with a bag so you can carry it around and it comes with a phone holder too so you can shoot with any device.
You can turn it in all angles when it comes to horizontally and vertically.

Acer Curve Monitor,"Posting this review after 6 months of rigorous use. This is a good tripod for mobile phones and can be used as an entry-level tripod for cameras as well, it can take weight of close to 5 kg cameras easily.

The quality of the tripod is good, it took the weight of my Sony Aplha ILCE 6000Y and my OnePlus 7 pro with ease.
Height of the tripod is close to 5 feet.
The tripod feet are sturdy and stand perfectly on any surface.
I have used it on mountains, streams and on the beach as well.
Quality wise if you plan on using your Mobile phone for doing some quality photography then this a must tripod to have.
As for cameras it can be used with point and shoot and light weight mirrorless cameras as well.

The only con is the locks which very stiff and take some force to open.",Helpful,4
Value for Money,"This stand has sufficient height.

Value for Money! but...,"Pros:
1. Lightweight
2. Tripod Bag provided by company
3. Aluminium body
4. 3 axis/ 360 degree rotation

6. Spirit level for horizontal shots
8. 50 inch height
9. Pricing is reasonable according to the Product
10. Mobile, DSLR Camera, Action camera, Camcorder can be mounted easily.
Cons:
1. Legs are not as much sturdy as a DSLR camera needs for stability
2. Leg brace adjustment is not stable as it should be. It moves upward/downwards whenever I move the tripod legs. There should be a lock or something that can fix the adjustment brace at any point on central axis.
3. Movement of 3way pan head is not so smooth. Whenever you are shooting something on video mode you need to take pan shots. So the head movement can be improved a lot.
Overall this product is good at this price. I recommend it for beginner video shoot or Photo shoot.",18,3
satisfied with the product- recommended it your budget is 15K,"It is lightweight and easy to use. The bag provided is useful to carry around. The tripod required some weight added at the base in moderate windy conditions and kept toppling over in very windy conditions. The mobile holder provided should only be used for smaller phones as it can damage larger phones due to the pressure applied on the sides. Also ideally, the tripod should be shorter in length when compressed so that it can fit into smaller bags such as back packs. Currently, it only appears to fit in checked luggage for travel.",4,3

However, the product comes with a 'Promotion Card', asking for customer to whatsapp them for a further 100 rupees discount.

Pictures Quality 4*. Sound Quality 2*,"I m writing this review after using this product for 2 weeks. I bought the 749/- one and i have to say that it is worth buying for beginners who dont want to invest too much on it. Few pros and cons of the tripod are:
#The three legs are not at the same level. But they can be adjusted using the locking clips
#The tripod has only one horizontal level bubble indicator. It would be really great if it would have two(at right angles to each other). But this can also be managed by the use of one's brain.
#The overall structure does not look strong enough to withstand a good sudden impact so you have to be careful while using it.
#Talking about looks....yeah it looks kinda good.

One more thing is, if you are buying it for flatlays, it will be of no use since the legs will be coming in frame whatever is the height of tripod. But it is cool for indoor photo shoots otherwise and its steadiness can definitely relied indoors.",Helpful,3

Good first time monitor,"The look and feel of the tripod is amazing. I personally loved the colour. It's smooth to the touch.
However, there are some glitches.
1. It may take you some time to figure the whole thing out, if you are a beginner.
2. The legs, feel like, one blow and they will break.
3. The material is not as sturdy as I was expecting.
4. Use the screws with patience. They are majorly plastic. And if you move them too quick, you may lose some parts of it. So.
5. Needs a lot of space when opened fully. Good for youtubers and vloggers and for reels.

The plus points of the tripod are:
1. Definitely the color and feel.
2. The mobile fone holder is quiet nice and strong. Saves your phone. That's one major major thing.
3. There are screws to adjust the angles and height of the tripod, giving you a perfect shot everytime.
4. Comes with a carry bag! A big big saviour.
5. It's quiet compact and travel friendly.
6. It supports other cameras too. Like go pro.

100% worst sound and some mode not working,The mobile holder option is just for advertisement. Its not adjustable and I really don't know what mobile will fit into that holder.. its a small u shaped piece of plastic. Worst buy even. The product is light weight but fragile... in term of stability it's too light to hold a heavy camera. On a stable surface and with someone holding it all the time it should stay. beginners with little experience shouldn't buy it. Or ur camera might fall and break apart,Helpful,5
What the hell!!!,"The tripod doesn't bear the weight of my 55-250 lens.

Good monitor and great packaging!,"I have been looking for a teleprompter since a longtime which would fit within my budget. After tirelessly searching for many days I came across DigioCraft Proshot Teleprompter. I was hesitant to buy it at first but then I took a step of faith and bought it. I must say that I am not disappointed at all.

The product is exactly how it is described in the Product Description. It is easy to assemble and much more easy to use. The best part for me personally was the access I got to numerous videos and lessons from the seller which helped me a lot to not only set up the teleprompter but also help me make effective videos.

I would recommend this product to all those who make videos at length and also to those who aspire to become effective speaker on videos. At this budget this is the best product available in the market. Go for it and don't think twice.
God bless you all!",One,4
Setting Up,"I was afraid of facing camera and was not able to speak over camera. I started looking for options then I stumbled upon the device called teleprompters. When I looked for the options, only we had imported ones with either low build quality(Chinese make) or too costly. But after few days research I found this ""DigioCraft Teleprompter"". Now I can write the script and place it in front of camera, and read it after a little practice, to record amazing facecam videos without hesitating much.
I ordered it and received in 2 days. After opening it, I found all the accessories and tools needed to assemble it & Video tutorial links. I started exploring the device and till now I am very happy with the product. Trials with the provided plexi sheet have been awesome and it never failed to impress me.
Pros:
1. Strong sturdy Build quality, heavy gauge steel.
2.All necessary tools(Allen key), glass cleaner, black dark cloth, carry bag,phone holder, 1/4"" screw, extra screws for body etc provided.
3.Works perfectly
4.Training material provided, is bonus.
5. Bluetooth remote works perfectly
6. Can fix DSLR or phone, both option accessories have been provided in the kit.

Cons:
Still exploring, till now , none.

Will keep posted with the videos of the product in action.",One,4
Basic features and good quality,"Products and suppliers like these on Amazon, actually make us come back to the store again and again. I thought it would be a budget friendly teleprompter with some basic features. But after looking at the packaging and after sales customer service I felt like giving a 5 star rating right away.

Pros:

1) Excellent quality of metal with industry standard gauge.

2) Good number of videos to assist you in assembling the DIY product.

3) Portability makes it easier to carry anywhere and set it up within minutes during the shoot.

4) Weight not more than 200gms.

5) Commendable Quality of the glass.

6) Comes with a lot of other goodies like mobile holder, iPad holder, good quality user friendly tools that help you in fixing the teleprompter.

7) Last but not the least, this is a perfect product for professionals who are into Video content creation for TV, YouTube and Online teaching.

Kudos to the manufacturers, I am looking for more products from this company as they understand the Indian customer very well who want quality at a best price possible.

BEST 24inch IPS 60hz Bezelless monitor under 12k," I have not been paid to make this review and this is my own experience.(which is awesome)
I was looking for a teleprompter for a project where the anchor has to read a script on a live broadcast. Most small sized teleprompter are fit on the lens of the camera which is something I don’t prefer. I saw some good reviews about this product and saw the demo videos on Youtube. I felt optimistic and placed the order.
I received the product and it was bit different from the video I had seen, so I placed a call to the number given. It was answered by the maker of the product himself and he came in on a whats app video call and explained everything. It took me just 10 mins to set it up.
Now about the product, there may be for bolts you may need to attach , otherwise it come 75% assembled. There are different attachments given for shooting with camera or a smart phone. There are options to mount the unit on a light stand or on a regular camera stand. All hardwares like screws and washers are provided and comes with an allen key and that’s all you need.
It’s a robust product and will last a life time because It has an all metal body and powder coated finish.
Two reflective mirrors of varying degree of reflection are provided and a practice acryclic sheet is also provided which is thoughtful.
The best part is, It’s a well balanced unit. That is, after mounting the camera, the camera lines up perfectly with the tripod and counter balances the weight of the teleprompter. This way there is less chance of wobble or shake.
Overall, this purchase and the experience has been really good!",One,4

Android instead of the Tizen software could have been better
Nothing else on the dislikes part",2,1
Dont have great expectations,"Damn 4k Display. Such a crispy picture. When i compared it with my friend's M5 the M7 gives an ultimate Crispy Visual output.

Awww the next feature.
With a Single Type C 3.1 Gen1 Cable I Got A 4K60Hz output + Audio Output + And its Charging my 15"" macbook pro. All in with a single cable.

Ohh the next feature is another level.
With the wireless DEX feature I'm really enjoying the Netflix with the basic 199 mobile plan from my Note20Ultra.

And the Airplay.. Ahhh whenever i roams with my macbook. I could even Airplay the contents to the monitor in HD Quality. But to be frank.. After i saw the 4K out, My airplay plans dropped. 4K is the best.

If you are a type C computer owner and if you love that crispy 4k display. You will fall in love with this monitor without any sec.

What I really didn't liked
A) They didn't included a type c cable. Normal consumer doesn't knkwnthe difference between the different types of C cables. And Samsung not clearly mentioned about the cable generations.

B) Their power cable is 16Amp which normally uses for AC and Refrigerators. And they didn't mentioned about that too..

Luckily because I'm working in the media field i had both C 3.1 gen1 cable and the 16amp-6amp adapter.

C) They are the OLED makers and they didn't used a OLED Screen for this costly monitor. But I never felt any issues with the the display because it looks same as my macbook pro retina display. But still I miss the deep black.",12,5
"Bad Product received, well handled by Amazon"," There was a very thin line between smart tv and desktop monitors, and Samsung has bridged the gap with this affordable monitor. The 4K one (M7) is worth it if you have the budget, otherwise M5 is a value for money deal.

Those who want a TV only, should not buy this though. 32"" is proper size for monitor, TVs nowadays looks better in 43+. There are many good display 43""+ 4K TV available in similar range. This stuff is primarily for regular computer monitor, with an additional benefit of a TV with remote. Its a pure joy watching ott content on your monitor with remote without the need to turn on your laptop. Picture quality is not that great, but good enough for computer monitor and your daily work. It has inbuilt speakers as well. Someone at Samsung really thought well about customers while designing this. Kudos to them.

Hope Samsung will keep the price same as introductory price. That really makes it a value for money device. A higher price would confuse user between this and other TV models at this range.

BTW, keyboard offer was great. Thanks Amazon. Thats not needed at all to interact with the monitor though, unless you use the inbuilt ms office 365, assuming most people will use it as a monitor for laptop/pc primarily.",11,5
Good Monitor but not as good on reliability.,#NAME?,6,5
Ok,"Pros:
Display of Samsung
TV with app, happy with tizen as it supports all streaming apps
Samsung Dex: with supporting phone can use all apps
Free keyboard and mice
2 Hdmi ports, see to switch between laptop and desktop

Cons:
Audio is okay for casual use...use external speakers or soundboard",One,5
Good monitor but over priced.,"I was initially looking just for a monitor as an extended display for my office laptop. During my research, I stumbled upon this smart monitor and thought it was interesting that it supported Netflix, Prime Video and YouTube without laptop connection. I was confused between the 27 inch model, the M5 and M7. I almost decided to go for the M5 after reading negative reviews for the M7. But I went with a gut feeling and decided to choose the M7.

But boy, was I in for a huge surprise. Below are the list of surprises that I observed in the first day itself.

1) While setting up the monitor to connect with the laptop, I realised that the laptop could be connected wirelessly, and you are free to take your laptop around without the restriction of wires.
2) This is a 4K monitor, so you can watch 4k videos on YouTube for free, and in Netflix for an additional fee. (Maybe other apps as well)
3) This monitor has Samsung TV Plus, which has its own set of TV channels. So its like you're watching your regular TV. However, do note that the channels are not much and not very exciting either. But given that your aren't paying a penny extra for this, it's welcome. (I've just explored this TV for a few hours, so there might be more to it).
4) This monitor also has a Web browser, and it is fairly easy to operate it using the remote. So any unsupported apps (like Hotstar, details below) can be run here.
5) This has a remote, which is such a convenient device to use.
6) The audio levels are really good for a bedroom of decent size.

However I must mention that there are a few glitches that I've observed during my first few hours with it (please do note that the below are my initial impressions and might change when I spend more time with it).

1) The monitor has voice assistant, with 3 different options: Bixby, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. I chose Alexa, but it doesn't seem to working as well as in Fire Stick. I'll be spending more time on it to fix the issue.
2) There is support for Apple Airplay, but when we did connect, we realised that the only supported app was Tunes Station, and it acted like an audio speaker of our iPhone without any video capabilities. The monitor does support Apple TV and Music, hence we are yet to test them.
3) You can also cast your Android phone wirelessly onto it, but the initial impression was just ok. Might change in coming days.
4) While setting up the monitor, I skipped the option of creating a Samsung account. I faced no issue while setting up Netflix, Prime Video, Zee5, etc. But while trying to install Hotstar, it did want me to login through Samsung account which I felt weird. (again this might change in coming days).
5) This monitor has only 60Hz refresh rate, which might not be good enough for gaming as well as for 4k content. If gaming is your primary purpose for buying a monitor, then there are other options with higher refresh rates and probably better screen panels.
6) This is not a Curved screen, hence viewing it in close proximity might not be a convenient experience (need to understand that better in coming days).

Some more untested features that I intend to explore in coming days:
1) This supports Bluetooth devices like keyboard, mouse, etc. Hence I might try out devices like a joystick, headphones to see how they work.
2) It also has various USB slots to connect hard drive, pen drives, etc.
3) Any Samsung phone with Android 8.1 or later can be mirrored onto the monitor simply by tapping the phone on the top or side of the monitor.

There might be many more which I've missed given that I've just spent I few hours with it.

However my delivery experience was not that great, since I was initially delivered a defective product. The return/replacement also wasn't as hassle-free as I wouldn't wanted it to be. But I commend the Amazon support team who ensured that it didn't end up becoming a horrendous experience.

Overall, I would say this is an excellent choice for someone who wants both an extended display for their office laptop, as well as a second TV for their bedroom. If you do not watch 4k content much, then go for the M5 Full HD one. But if budget is a concern, go for the 27 inch model. There's also a 43 inch 4k model. But I'd recommend that only if this will be your primary TV, as well as if your WFH setup allows such a huge sized device. Unfortunately, at this moment there are no other smart monitors available, hence the choices are limited. But I have to say, the choices are really good.

Hope this review helps you in making a right decision. Good luck. :)",2,5
Faulty Monitor Received," The monitor features everything like a smart TV... It has a enough viewing angle, speaker volume is good, 2 HDMI ports(HDMI 1 with ARC), 2 USB ports... Remote option is also fantastic 😊 we can also connect Bluetooth speaker, headset, and mirror our phone to monitor, voice assistant (by adding our Google account).
Only drawback is the connector 😒 Attached the pic... It comes with the 16amp big connector for which yu have to buy a separate adaptor...

Overall satisfied with the monitor..😊👍",Helpful,5
Worst ips glow bleeding ever,"For those who are casual content consumer's and casual gamers, this is the product to go for.

I was given a sum amount from my office to purchase work from home equipments and I am happy that I purchased this.

Pros.
1. You can connect upto two laptops via hdmi cable. Both my laptops are 720 and 1080p which scales to proper 4k on this monitor. Such an amazing experience to work on a bigger and vibrant screen especially when your laptops are only 14inch and you have been working on them for more than 5 years.
2. It's a proper samsung TV. I also own a Q95 samsung flagship tv and this monitor has the same user interface. So you can watch all those streaming application from Netflix, prime, hotstar and more. It has a good contrast ratio so you have to tweak the settings accordingly. And the 4k content is just amazing.
3. 4k gameing @60fps is sweet on this monitor. No complaints so far.
4. Connectivity- It's remote connectivity option is simple and smooth, it can also be used as a stand alone desktop if you have a office365 account. It also has one tap screen share option with Samsung mobiles.

Overall a feature loaded value for money option.
Those who are looking for an extra TV for bedroom and also who work on poor screen laptops provided by office, this monitor becomes an excellent choice.",One,5
"Text and picture is blurry, side by side comparison with my LG 27MP77HM.","Simply put, this is the swiss army knife of monitors. It has wireless connectivity features such as Wireless display (Windows), Airplay 2 (Apple devices) and Screen mirroring (Android devices), all of these through Wifi. Wireless devices like TWS earphones can be connected using Bluetooth 4.2. Wired connectivity options include USB Type C (display + 65W charging capability!), HDMI and USB Type A ports for devices like mouse, keyboard etc. All of these works fine.

During leisure time it can double as a Smart TV with WiFi. Perfect for work from home setups!

Cons:
- VA Panel is not great, IPS would have been better.
- Large 16A plug, so adaptor will be required if the socket is smaller.
- Annoying Samsung TV Plus app which plays by default in the home, but this can be disabled.",Helpful,4

-the smart features are great and works like a charm
-usb c port there for 1 cable solution
- screen is bright and nice for entertainment
- everthing including the remote is well built
-airplay works very well

cons

- i had expectatipoons for office 365 but its slow as hell , literally no one mentioned it in reviews
- usb c cable not included for asian regions(its there for us varients) so had to spend another 2k on that
-its a va panel not an ips one so not as reliable for proffessionals
-15amp socket included, luckily i had one so no issues but many homes dont have that lying around like that, they are near washing machine or geyser points",Helpful,3
Best QHD Monitor under 20K right now,"This product is innovative and I like using it. Few cons but I hope samsung will fix it.

Cons:
1.) when using in closed dark room, there will be a unneessary brightness which will hit your eyes and wont let to continue watch the monitor. as a workaround, I always have to turn on white light so the extra brightness coming from Monitor will be destributed.

2.) HDMI supports 4k monitor input with 30 hz refresh rate so if using it as a montot with 4k will slowdown your work since the mouse will flicker due to slow refresh rate. but when using USB C supported laptop with this montor, It supprts 4K with 60 hz refresh rate.",45,5

Good monitor for the price. Using on Mac as external.,"When you say smart then it should perform smart and that how exactly this monitor does

Build : sturdy and perfectly build to stand on a table with perfect weight balance

Picture: the range is dynamic and the Color scheme is perfect with a good dynamic range

Sound : decent for a monitor as that is not it’s primary job

Smart feature : much needed for wfh these days the Multi view is a bit doggy as it can only work with a Samsung phone but the inbuilt apps work perfectly

Accessories : the remote is small and handy similar to all Samsung tv remotes and the smart connectivity app works perfectly and replaces the remote

Pros : picture quality, build and performance

Cons : 16A plug haven’t , Multi screen functionality working only with Samsung phones

Cost : worth the money if you are looking for a monitor who’s primary purpose is to extend your workspace or laptop and add few smart features",21,5
No defects and clear picture,"I am using this monitor M5, I feel it's value for money as I can use it for both my office work as well as for watching movies. It has few useful features like, bluetooth connectivity option, wireless display connection. I could share my laptop screen over wifi but it has lag.

Other than that, it has integrated apps like Netflix, prime video and Samsung TV plus. Even we can install additional apps, though the market place seems to have limited apps. I could install hotstar.

Great screen but bad seller,Software issues with this Samsung M7 monitor. It’s not working properly I’m not able to go to the app’s and settings with remote. I don’t understand why Amazon people always change their contact settings I don’t know how to contact Amazon . You people are making customers very complicated to contact you this is very bad. Once the return window closes that’s the end of it. Amazon is avoiding customers not taking the responsibility. If this continues there’s going to be a big issue in future.,4,5
Monitor is 60Hz not 75Hz,The main advantage is that the monitor comes with a remote it is same as the Samsung smart TV remote. With the remote you can seamlessly switch between TV and Monitor mode. The monitor have 2 HDMI ports and one is with ARC. But i have experiencing an issue that except YouTube none of the smart TV apps support ARC sound output. Amazon prime or any other app sound output only will come through the Bluetooth. I have connected a sound bar using HDMI ARC but only in YouTube will get the sound.,One,5
The Best in Budget - Has G-Sync + Free Sync,"Quick review - This device CAN NOT BE RETURNED and it DOES NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS11 Think Twice before purchasing this monitor because Amazon Customer Service just told me that I should have known that this device does not work with Windows 11. It's more of a TV than a monitor. Very cumbersome to connect to Windows 10 and not easy to use. It changes the cursor and overall you don't get the smooth connection that you get from a dedicated monitor. Please buy a dedicated monitor if you need one. I made a huge mistake by going for this so-called smart monitor.

Feedback after using the monitor for 3 months - The monitor is now working with Windows 11. My last review was based on initial experience and first impression. Upgrading my rating as have spent more time using it. I find the device quiet useful as Smart TV cum monitor.",Helpful,5
Excellent monitor - you are paying for the quality,"I am writing this review after 15 days of using the M5 27inch smart monitor: It is a decent monitor for programming activity but not for gamers or graphics designees. but the price is a bit high comparing the feature it offers. I would expect a more refreshing rate and low response time within the price range. It would be great to have more resolution than 1920X1080 with a monitor of 27inch but I am ok with the resolution. Don't go for this monitor just by looking into the fancy things it offers like OTT apps specifically. There are a lot better options available in the market within the price range(23899.00/- INR). The few good things are build quality, the look is really premium, connectivity options are relatively better (more connectivity options mostly connecting mobile devices), the inbuilt speakers produce good quality sound, you can really take advantage of the monitor size as you can work with multiple windows side by side which is obvious with any 27inch monitor, the Installation is really easy.",2,5
Liked it,"After a long research of finding a 32 inch which can provide multi tasking features, then finally zeroed on this TV. Also believed the reviews on amazon! I was more specific on a TV cum monitor as I previously owned a 24 inch LG TV monitor bought in 2008 and still working like a horse but sans remote. Since I was keen on a slightly bigger screen with better resolution for my aging eyes was certainly a wrong decision!!! Purchased this TV on republic day. Expected a price discount but went ahead after finding none! BUT...the price was reduced by 1k the next day! I am removing 1 star for this type of bad marketing by the seller. My big advice to everyone, never never purchase anything on the first day of some big festival sales. Discounts happen from second day only and I have seen complaints from buyers regarding this bad attitude of sellers!

Coming to the device. Pls remember that this is the ONLY tv which provides UHD resolution in 32 inch models. Picture clarity was just ok. Linked wirelessly to my laptop easily. But had to sit min 10 feet away as my eyes couldn't take the eye strain! If you are looking at monitor aspect then I request buyers to go for 24inch rather. Coming to the software, which is tizen and not android, there are lot of glitches. TV hangs while switching from Amazon ott to Netflix! Sometimes USB drive doesn't recognize and will have to reboot the TV right from power supply! Bluetooth is pathetic! Doesn't recognize Bluetooth sound bars! Each error forces me to reboot the TV! Sound is just ordinary with zero bass. Wasted money on a sound bar! Finally I am repenting for purchasing and will have to live with it! Buyers decide and buy.",35,4
Best IPS 240Hz monitor for this price. Wish it was 1440p though,"Bad points first because people are more interested in it.
1. No USB type C cable came with it which I saw in youtube reviews in US version.
2. USB type C port available is just for charging device. Doesn't support Macbook fast charging.
3. This is not a usb type C monitor just in case you want to connect your monitor with type C cable.
4. Colour are average. not what I expected with Samsung panel.
5. Sound quality is very poor. I am complaining because company selling it as smart monitor. There is also no sound output port to connect with external speakers. So you cannot enjoy movies on it.
6. Power cable is 16 A, so you have buy either new 6A cable or new 16A extension port.

Good points
1. Good Thing about this monitor is that it can work independently as smart TV if not working on computer.
2. No screen bleeding observed.
3. Fast startup and good monitor remote response.
4. Packed with many features.",4,4
Marvellous,"Please read before buying:

I have been using a 32"" FHD LED Samsung TV as my computer display since past 12 years now, due to moisture damage it developed lines and bands so opted to buy this moni-TV after a lot of research. All the reviews are positive but none of them mention the biggest deal killer - GHOSTING.

The ghosting on this moniTV is unreal. Display LED pixels take fraction of a second to change colours, when that fraction is higher, the motion tends to make a trail on screen. Typically if a black/dark object moves in lighter background, you will see a yellow shadow or trail which gives it a ghostly effect, hence its called Ghosting. And Oh boy! Ghosting on this display is sooo freaking bad! I did not expect this from Samsung brand at all. Seriously.

Then there is the display hue issue. The screen looks a garbled mess of colors. I mean its almost fluorescent in color scheme and reducing tint/color/saturation does not help anyhow. So if you're looking at a photo of flowers, the green tips of leaves will look distinctively fluorescent green, the reds will have their own saturations and the yellow blues look washed out. This display reminded me of cheap 350rs display I got on my Samsung Monte mobile when I broke the screen, some 15 years back.

Ok if its this bad then why have I still given more than 1 star? Well thats because this review is very nitpicking. In a world where we have subpar brands that give 43"" in 15K, Samsung has really not made a big mistake. The display is really smart, there are good apps and free samsung tv with it. If you use this on a wall and sit 4-5 feet away, may be you will not see all these differences. May be the display I got was particularly messed up. May be your display will not have all these issues. Or may be it will. I tried to check this moniTV in Croma/Reliance Digital, its not available offline - so there is no way to see before buying.

All in all - its a passable TV for SD DTH boxes, garbage for pc/text work and a good smart TV with good apps. I got the 32"" M5 of 29999 for 20k after all the discounts, it seriously hurt me to return this and burn more money to go for a 34K Samsung UHD 43"", but the 43"" is total bang for buck :D",Helpful,4
Nice Product :),"Very good smart TV with future ready features. Not a monitor at all, the basic features of monitor are missing. Samsung tried it's best to create a hybrid version and it's not enough. 32"" monitor should have screen split and screen resolution adjustments. Appreciate the PC on screen option which will allow users to access personal cloud accounts with click of a button. The OS isn't great and fast enough, Samsung please push updates to optimize and improve performance. Overall its a one in kind smart TV with future ready options. Not a monitor at all.",One,4
"Overall Good, but only for heavy gamers","For those of you who don't know 16 amp socket is what we have for AC, Fridge and washing machine's. It's a high voltage and high amp socket which has separate wiring in the house. You won't be able to run this monitor on a normal traditional plug. These big sockets are only a few specific places in the house like the bathroom, utility area and kitchen. Even if you hire an electrician to install this plug they have to extend the wiring through the wall which can be pretty expensive(Depending on how close a 16amp connection is). In some cases, it is impossible to do so. Even if you somehow manage to do so take a note that 16 amp sockets aren't connected to an inverter, so if you experience a frequent power outage you screen will shut down even if you have an inverter/generator running.

In my case, I have just installed the 16 amp socket from the traditional 5 amp connection, I constantly live in fear of either a short circuit or my display getting damaged.

So before you buy it make sure you have a 16amp socket nearby your workspace",Helpful,4

Excellent for price,"ALERTT !! I know you are looking for a good monitor, and BELIEVE me I have went through all the reviews as of 3/1/2022 before buying this monitor. And this is my honest review of this product:

Pros:
- FHD display and all is good but IPS display would be better.
- Phone mirror/casting works good.
- Sleek design and premium feel.
- inbuilt speakers

Cons:
- Wireless connection with laptop is not at all good! It has sooo muchh of delayyy while screen sharing and picture quality is not good better use HDMI. So kind of it's no use buying this expensive monitor.

- As response time is not good it's not at all fit for gaming.

- There isn't any VGA port and sound lead. So you can't connect external speakers, just Bluetooth speakers. (Believe me this hurts)

- Refresh rate is 60hz, if you are a gamer go for other monitors (acer nitro would be a better option), and this monitor isn't for gaming at all!.

CONCLUSION: Netflix and stuff is good but this monitor lacks many essential features as a standard monitor, my honest answer would be please don't buy this product, look for other better options in this price range(you could save money and get better display quality with good refresh rate), one without speaker would be also better then this, atleast they will provide you with a sound input.

The next time if I buy any monitor if it has exchange offer will surely exchange this.🥲",Helpful,4
Best 240hz monitor,"This product is very basic monitor, look wise and feel wise. I think a old product I bought just seeing Samsung and price.

Fantastic monitor with some QC issues,"The M5 32"" (₹ 25000) appears to be a bang for the buck over the M7 32"" variant(₹ 37000).
The only two differences being -

1. Screen resolution - 1080P (M5) vs 4K (M7)
2. USB C to C option for 65W charging & connectivity is present in M7 & not in M5.

However the USB C to C cable is not included in the M7 OOTB package for which you will need to shed out another 1000 odd bucks to get the compatible cable and make use of the connectivity option. Huge disappointment on that front.

M5 32"" is still a desirable monitor cum Tv @ ₹ 25000 given the value proposition it offers while M7 falls flat, charging a bomb.

For 37000, you can get a massive 4K HD LED IPS Redmi TV at 55"" against the minuscule 32"" inch 4K HD LED VGA Samsung M7 smart monitor, if you desire for a good TV. If you are just after the monitor & not the TV, 25K M5 variant would suffice more than needed.

Detailed Review :

What's in the box? 🎁

1. 32"" VGA Monitor & a stand with required screws. (Yeah you've seen it right, it's VGA and not IPS)
2. Power Adapter
3. HDMI - HDMI Cable
4. Remote with batteries

What's not? 🚫

USB type C-C cable for 65W charging is NOT included as part of the M7 package and the feature in itself is not available in the M5 32""/27"".

What's great? 😻

1. TV + Monitor all in one interface, pre loaded with the YouTube/Prime/Netflix/Hotstar/Zee5/Apple TV+ apps.

2. Display & visual calibration - Despite being a VGA panel, I've zero complaints on the display quality and the available calibration options. I haven't witnessed any ghosting/black bleeding regardless of the surrounding brightness. Eye Care & Adaptive Display calibration are good & I'm sure with the subsequent software updates, display options and calibrations will only grow from strength to strength.

3. Seamless transition from Tv to Work & back : Thanks to the Tizen OS. All it takes is just a remote click and I'm already loving to swap between the TV & the Work Monitor without much ado or efforts.

4. Remote - The best part of it all. Minimalistic yet effective. This makes the experience so rewarding. Offers the comfort from wherever you are.

5. Audio quality - Oh boy, this blew me off! Nobody would've expected a monitor to perform so well in this area. The Amplification option is ""real loud"" and trust me you won't need to tune beyond 25 so not to invite the fury of your neighbours. Audio quality is exceptionally good given its price range. Hey but, don't expect the Atmos / Bass effect. It does it's job over and above. DOT. It even allows you to pair a bluetooth headset/speaker if in case you need. The BT headphone option for sure helps those late night binge watchers with parents/kids next room.

6. AirPlay support - Perhaps the only non mac monitor to come up with an inbuilt AirPlay support. You can mirror your iOS / MacOs / iPadOs devices with an one time pairing. Works reasonably good although the efficacy lies in the strength of your Wifi.
But make no mistake, the monitor doesn’t support HomePods / HomePods Mini yet for Audio streaming. I wish they enabled this feature. This monitor and HomePods for audio would’ve summed up a quality entertainment.

What's Meh? 😼

1. Tizen/Samsung App Store is still evolving and you won't find a lot of Indian OTT/News apps in there yet. But all the major ones mentioned above are already available.

2. Bixby Voice assistant is still mediocre.

3. Not for ardent gamers. Screen refresh rate tanks at 60Hz.

4. No Ethernet port making it entirely relying on Wifi. So unless you’ve a strong Wifi, you can’t leverage the Tv features much.

5. Wireless screen mirroring has a lag and that’s understandable. However the wireless mirroring supports only the screen refresh rate of 30 Hz against the capable 60 Hz. As well the screen resolution is supported only at 720P / 1080P against the 4K.",3,3

The delivery guy this time thought the product inside was a table and was throwing the carton once while taking it out of the vehicle at my gate, second time at my door while putting the product at my door step, when I asked why are you throwing it. He said it doesn’t seem like a monitor I thought it was a table and you can replace it if there’s any damage also there were damages to the cardboard box in which the monitor was there at the time of delivery. This is pathetic delivery service, Amazon should atleast write somewhere to handle with care. Not sure what will happen to my return now.

Just Awesome,"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning deal

Following are my observations:
1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.
2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.
3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.
4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.
5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.
6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.
7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.
8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.

Monitor has following ports:
D-Sub
HDMI Port
Display Port
Line-in port and
3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphones

This monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.

Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.
Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.

Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!",2,4
Good for price,"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.
Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.
The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbage

Poor Resolution need to update the monitor driver,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.

My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.
Pros:
- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.
- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.
- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.
- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.
Cons:
- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.

Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.

Let me know if you need to know more.",One,4
Cannot change brightness from windows,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24” inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.

Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn’t even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.

As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.
After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.

I found the feature “Low blue light” and “Brightness intelligence technology” - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.
Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to “Low blue light emission”.

In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.
I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.

I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can’t say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.

I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen.",One,4
Honest review after 2 Months,"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )
Pros:
1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's
from dell.
2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.
3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that
4. Brightness is way too much high
5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)

Cons
1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)

At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.
if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you.",One,4
Acer up to date.,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.

However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.

First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:

1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)
2. Contrast: 60
3. Sharpness: 5
4. Gamma: 5
5. Color Temperature: Normal
6: Hue: 50
7. Saturation: 50

Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:

1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start, you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.
2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.
3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.
4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.
5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.
6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)

And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.

One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels).",Helpful,4
"Very good quality, best buy at this price.","The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).

Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.

My overall experience with this monitor is amazing.",Helpful,4

Cheap and surprisingly good LCD monitor," The product is very good. Eye care setting has options like Multimedia, Reading etc... I usually keep Multimedia while playing games and Reading when I am coding and doing office work. I usually spend 8 hrs per day infront of PC, I didn't experience any eye strain. Vertical adjustment is not there, so if you have comfortable chair and table, it's good. Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client. Build quality is good. I bought it for 7750Rs, Because of Corona pandemic prices are increasing, I don't have any option and didn't wait for the deals. I feel happy for purchasing this.",Helpful,4
Good monitor,"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure.",One,4
Decent product,"I know you guys must be wondering why my review title says ""Dont buy"" but I have given 4 star rating to this product. It's because this product comes with a 16A 150V power adapter.

I had to purchase separate power cord to work with this monitor.

Nice,"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.

The good -
- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.
- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.
- The viewing angles are excellent.
- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.
- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.
- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.
- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.
- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.

The bad -
- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.
- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.

Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!",2,3
Justifying the price,"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ₹17,500, a good ₹3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.

On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.

Like I said, the Dell's display panel is, in my opinion, superior to the BenQ's. Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.

To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more.",One,3

Being an IPS panel, this monitor suffers from back light glow. Blacks are not fully black. This is not noticeable if one is working in well lit environment. However, in a dark environment at night it does cause eye strain.

The buttons on the monitor are physical push buttons. It would have been great if they were touch buttons. Physical buttons tend to get defective over a period of time.",One,3
Nice...go for it,I m already using 24inch monitor of same brand. I m satisfied with functional quality. Hence ordered 27inch one. To my surprise it came with16A power plug unlike predecessor. I dont see that's highlighted in description. Now I m struggling to find 16A power point in my office room.Finally i got adaptor. I wish it should have been highlighted better,Helpful,3
Very Good moniter for this price,"Bought it for my Dell XPS laptop so that I can have a bigger screen. The build is solid and the cable management is great. The monitor stand is also very good as the monitor does not tip over easily. Max resolution is 1920 so don't expect it to have a greater area like a 4K monitor.

Less one star as I had to do a lot of calibration for colour. The inbuilt modes are not great. I had to switch to user defined mode and calibrate the colour a lot. Finally after 1 hour of fiddling with the modes and settings of the monitor, I was able to get the right colour.

Since it is an LCD monitor (not LED), the font on windows 10 look blurry. You need to set the cleartype option in the windows settings so that you get sharp fonts. Do not compare it with other high end monitors like gaming or photo editing. They are better but more expensive.

If you are looking for a bigger area to work on, buy a monitor which supports 1440 or higher resolution. Note the resolution also depends on the graphics card support. If you have a 4K monitor but the graphics card does not support it, any monitor will run on max 1920 resolution.

For daily use like word processing and programming, this monitor is great especially the cable management and back side design.",Helpful,3
"Ordered LED, received LCD. Acer wont replace or return.","The blue light filters works well and make it comfortable to read for long time... bezel is narrow...only issue I am facing is that when blue filter is enabled in reading mode monitor does not allow to vary brightness or other picture settings...it's prest...without filter enabled settings can be varied. The auto brightness adjust is an added feature, though it works... It does not make much difference to the picture....in addition to providing setting to vary sensitivity they should also have provided gain",Helpful,3
Average monitor,"The monitor is well built. Quality is also good. However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff. The fonts will look blurred. It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution. 24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes. If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones. Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!",One,3
Decent monitor,"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.
Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.
Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,
Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,
The ports, there should have been at least one display port.
Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)
Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.
The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.

I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.
Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.
Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.
I am disappointed.
Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display.",Helpful,2
Overall good product for price,"It’s a great product for the price but terrible service in Chennai. The monitor I received has one display port and one HDMI and the display port isn’t working. So I called BenQ customer care and was put in touch with the local service provider. But the local service provider refused to even come take a look at the product and tried to resolve all my queries through phone/WhatsApp! He gave me all the most obvious solutions that any person with electronics knowledge would try before calling customer care—maybe he assumed because I’m a woman, I don’t know even basic things about cables and cable quality. Even after I tried to explain that I’ve tried everything he was suggesting, his only advice was to buy more expensive cables. Very annoying and ultimately futile.",Helpful,2
Ok,"I needed more space along with my macbook pro and after looking at the ratings I bought this. Most of the time I work using terminal app and font is not crisp, letters are faded and pixelated when used with small fonts. Color reproduction is awful. Now i regret the purchase as this can not be returned (replacement is available but that will not serve my purpose). Instead I should have purchased 24"" monitor. If you use very large fonts and internet browsing or entertainment is your primary purpose, then go for it.

If you want decent resolution on 27"" inch go for WQHD/QHD, but not full hd.",40,1
Poor picture quality,"GW2480 24-inch - Got it for just below INR 10K.
Overall it is just a average to good monitor for day-to-day usage. But nothing impressive.
Pros:
* All the usual functions work as expected
* Picture quality is good but one needs to set the brightness very high to get better picture quality.
* Although the bezels are thin, it looks sturdy.
* HDMI cable included in the pack. So, no need to buy that separately (like few other monitors in the market)
* Wall mounting
* Several preset picture modes
* Price-INR 10K
Cons:
* Slight darkening of the panel on both vertical sides near the edges when viewed exactly from middle on low brightness (around 40% or less). This is kind of typical LCD drawback of old days but didn't expect it from Benq brand. That too in 2021. But this goes away for higher brightness is set (of course, that will strain the eyes)
* Although there are several preset picture modes with respective brightness/contrast with bright display, most of the pre-defined ones are too bright for daily usage and one can't adjust the brightness and some other settings for these pre-defined modes.

Felt that my 10 year old Dell All-in-one 2310 had better display overall (although bit enhanced colour & colour/contrast calibration wasn't possible with it).

I was bit skeptical before buying and that skepticism was very valid I guess. As these companies churn out these monitors with less than INR 10K, I guess they are cutting some corners.",15,1
Good,"UPDATE:
the monitor actually has a good firmware, you can customize 2 buttons the way you want it! haven't seen such feature anywhere, stupid marketing team should have highlighted it!
Now I can turn up and down brightness and change picture modes as I want it!

STILL NOT 4 STAR ABOVE SINCE IT HAS FLICKER ISSUES SOMETIMES

1st impressions as below, update above.
The product is marketed for its eyecare technology which they do by providing a blue light filter shortcut. but the most annoying thing is you cannot switch between different picture modes without this blue light filtering. and the worst part is you cannot turnoff the filter by clicking the same button instead you will have to go to the settings and navigate through a maze of options and change back to normal mode!",4,1
Good product,"The monitor is good and the clarity is superb. There is no flicker. Picture clarity is good.
If you are doing UI design using this monitor then you need to be careful as some colors appear differently than what is visible in laptop. The inbuilt speaker is pathetic and hardly audible.
Another disappointing issue was with the monitor adaptor plug. They have sent a 16 A big plug which will not fit in regular plug point. [Attached image]. Even after calling their customer care or whatapps images there was no response. Then I had to run around to buy a suitable adaptor. Hence 2 stars less.",One,1
Poor Screen Quality,"There is no option to reduce Brightness, though blue light is filtered, we are unable to reduce the brightness which is stinking eyes especially during nights and brightness sensor though working it doesnot make difference to the brightness and we are ending up using more tubelights to reduce screen glare and thereby ending up in using up more electricty, so the purpose of eye care is not solved during nights.",2,1
Good,"I was a SAMSUNG Monitor user from long time. Initially I had SAMSUNG CRT monitor and after that LCD monitor 18 inch one. I used them for many years. After lots of research on internet I decided to buy this Benq monitor. But, after using it for more than 1 month, here are my opinion about this monitor.

PROS :-

- Looks and Build quality is awesome.
- Cable management at its best. If your monitor is going to be visible from backside also, then you should definitely buy this monitor.
- 2 HDMI Ports is a advantage.
- Brightness auto adjustment sensor is also very good addition and its works perfectly. After using this you will get used to it and it is very difficult to go back again.
- Stand is very sturdy and simple yet stylish.
- Overall Image quality is good considering this is the cheapest IPS LED Full HD monitor.

CONS :-

- If you are a tech person then you are NOT going to like its Display quality. It is good but NOT excellent. Overall I am NOT happy as I am a tech person. For normal people this is a very good display.
- Only VGA cable is provided in the box and NO HDMI cable. This is really SAD. Quality of image from VGA cable connection is Average. Strangely it is showing some flickering on screen which is NOT good. I don't know it is only for my unit or everyone is facing it.
- Factory Color calibration is NOT at all good. You have to adjust many settings according to your requirement.
- After connecting with HDMI cable I observed that it is showing too much whiter shade in black areas which is NOT good. It was not the case with VGA connection for same settings.
- If you use it on User Defined Picture mode then it shows nice colors and deep blacks.

Conclusion:-

If your budget is strictly low and you want good monitor, then only buy this one. Or I strongly suggest you go with LG monitors.",One,1
Stand quality is not good,"Pros:
1. Speakers (Hardly any others have)
2. HDMI ports 2 (No other in this price segment)
3. A good screen and sturdy stand
4. Auto brightness adjustment sensor

Cons:
1. Useless VGA cable (after 2019 which laptop comes with VGA port??) HDMI cable is must.
I tried using type-c to VGA adaptor, monitor works but speakers do not work.
2. Not so great speakers (don't think of using it as TV)
3. Backlight bleed all over (typical IPS)
4. HDMI ports are very near, cannot put a cable and fireStick together (2 cables will work easily)

It could have been really handy if it had USB ports, but no !

I bought this on sale, costed me Rs. 6750, worth the money, I am going to keep this despite of cons but due to the pros. I would recommend buying if you are ok with these cons.",4,1
Ok," This monitor has been good for 3 years which I bought at 11512 INR. It suddenly started flickering after 39 months 2 days for which I could not avail warranty (the warranty is for 39 months). I contacted Benq service center and they were very prompt in addressing the issue. But, they confirmed it a problem of the panel which is very costly to replace (costs close to the monitor itself). Also, the replaced panel has a warranty for 3 months only. So, repairing is not at all worthy. They provided no extended warranty for 2 days or any other adjustment. So, I have to buy a new monitor ( I am done with Benq). The manufacturer precisely calculated the average lifespan and set the warranty period. For a longer lifespan and durability, choose LG or Dell. It is not value-for-money for the long run. I gave 2 stars for the 3 years working.",Helpful,1
Shocked to see lines on screen while unboxing,"The monitor is what you pay for... The screen is too bright with very poor contrast for any night time work. The contrast is soo bad that to see anything dark clearly, you have to crank up the britghtness. This means you cant work in the dark or night time.
The whole idea of LOW BLUE LIGHT and eye strain etc is defeated if you screen is too bright.
The speakers are a joke, my 5 year old laptop has better speakers. and a monitor DOES NOT NEED speakers.
This feels more like a bad TV than a good monitor.

All said, i still bought it because it was cheap, and have a great DELL monitor i can use for low light performance.",498,5
Found display issue... highly disappointed,Let me highlight the negatives. There is no usb port. Connecting a webcam is not possible and you need to run it down to the CPU. Only one hdmi port. The second one is display port and to connect a second device is near to impossible since you cannot find a hdmi to display port cable. Adding that cable to the package instead of widely available hdmi cable would have been an added value.,381,5
Received a broken screen,"The first product I received has an issue i.e a dark or dull area near the bottom right corner. I thought this is a defective one and ordered a replacement.

However I was shocked when the second product I received has the same issue in the same spot.

Somehow this issue is not present in the logo/loading screen. It is also barely noticeable in dark movies while too much happening on the screen. But is definitely an issue in white scenes or softwares.

I have attached picture of this issue. This issue is more prominent when you you put the brightness less than 40 or so.

Below is the detailed review of this product:

Pros:
> Nice bezels
> Cable management system
> Build quality feels durable
> white to black separation is good
> Colour looks ok after some tweaking

Cons:
> Brightness uniformity is a big issue. Some part of the screen looks dull or darker than others.
> Black is not pure black but grey like
> There is some back light bleed issue in dark environment but ok as per the price point
> Brightness is too high even for 0 settings. Not at all suitable for working in a dark environment.

Final thoughts:
If you are going to work on creative apps like Photoshop or some other editing softwares then please don't buy it. For watching movies and other entertainment purpose it is ok.

On every white screen like Google Chrome or Microsoft office softwares you will notice the dark area on the screen due to the brightness uniformity issue.",111,5
Worrest color," I bought 2 monitors on this last Aug, But one of them keep on getting issues like Horizontal pixel lines and flickering problem. So I thought it's my bad luck that I got a manufacturing defect product. So I returned it and requested for a replacement.
The Amazon shipping was too good that the replacement came in 2 or 3 days .. But again this worst horizontal pixel line popped up into the replacement monitor after 1 week. So I returned the replacement monitor too... I wonder what happened to benq.. that their monitor is not even lasting 2 weeks! I tried it 2 freaking times coz I like Benq... Now I'm in confistion that I should again go for benq or I should find some other brand ... Please suggest if you guys got any good ones other than this..because God already gave me 2 chances ... I don't wajt to spoil the third one tbh",215,5
Not value for money,"1) Provided only 16Amp power cable. Meant this monitor designed to be used in Kitchen or bathroom where normally 16amp socket available. Not for bedroom nor living room use. -5 stars.

2) only VGA cable but no HDMI cable. -4 stars.

3) No return option even the item is not fit to use in normal Indian household and latest laptop. -3 stars.

About monitor performance?

Pointless to talk about performance when the monitor cannot even power on..

Manufacturer should provide correct cables as accessories.

Not good for movie as the refreshing rate is too slow, not able to show fast motion. For office purpose, the clarity is not there",65,5
The monitor wont switch on,"i purchased this monitor and the internal panel was damaged within 3 months. after long follow up for 2 months. i got reply from customer service that it was broken by external force ..they never replied to my follow up emails. the company said enginner will visit site but he never did. i also followed up with amazon regarding the issue. although their service is generally good, i did not receive any reply from amazon regarding the issue despite follow ups . maybe because it was out of return / replacement period.

although there is no visible damage in display, its not covered by warranty. the cost of the panel is same as the new monitor (rs. 8000). besides, they are not available in india. hence i will be cautious of buying benq again. while it was working the display quality was good but after sales service was disappointing. i purchased another dell monitor from amazon.",73,5
"LED not , LCD monitor","Made a mistake of buying this for coding, but the issue is the pixel density is <163PPI, and that makes the text a bit blurrish. Discovered this very late after changing HDML cables and DP cables and playing around with scaling options etc...

Definitely not for Mac.

One thing that can help is keep the display mirroring ""on"" and used scaled display to make text sharper (because a scaled down picture reduces the screen area).",37,5
Don't buy,"Probably I am one of those few people to get hands on both Dell 2419h & Benq GW2480T.

I must say that both of them are plagued with manufacturing defects, such as backlight bleeding and uneven rendering of colours. Typical Chinese with no quality control. Only went with them as there were no alternatives.

The backlight bleeds can be noticed on darker videos (especially on right side corners), and uneven colours can be noticed with white/grey backgrounds where some parts of screen may appear as yellowing and rest whiter.

This is my 3rd monitor after returns/replacements and still face the same issue. I thinking to retains this piece not because it's better than remaining ones, but rather because I'm tired of this replacement/returns process.

If you trust any local shop then I would suggest to go with it rather than online in amazon, because getting a good electronic product (especially displays) is matter of pure luck here.

Update:
Found dead pixel on bottom left part of screen. So enough compromises, returning it off.",46,5
There is Backlight Glow (Not Leaking / Normal for IPS Panel) But The Quality and Colors are amazing.,"The two in-built speakers are nothing but a joke. Even if place myself right up close to the the monitor (one foot from the monitor...the only thing between me and the monitor is the keyboard), the audio is very low. The volume from this monitor set to max is not even 20% from the single speaker of that of my mobile phone (Redmi Note 7) placed exactly at the same location.

I am not expecting a TV like volume from this. But the speakers are not even audible. I need a monitor with built in speakers to go through some videos etc quickly without having to connect my sound bar etc.

For such an awful speaker volume, they should not describe the product as one with built-in speakers. I am going to have to return this.

I am not going to comment on the picture quality at this point because I have not validated it enough as I have made up my mind to return it.",24,5

Great Value for Money,"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it. After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time. In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours! I returned it after four days of wasted effort. May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415. The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same. Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain! The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!

Amazing Monitor with great picture quality and good viewing angles,"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I’ll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.

Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.

Coming to monitor:
1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.
2) It claims it is an IPS display but it’s just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.
3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you’re sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.
4) And about speakers I’m still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.

I don’t know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I’m starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it’s ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it’s the product itself. Anyways I’m not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.
Either ways I’m returning it never to buy this product again. I’ll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products.",4,4
Exceptional viewing experience,"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.

I would urge every buyer to not buy this product ever as I have lost my 12k in this plus I am on leave for my office for not having monitor. These salary deductions are extra losses for me",9,4
For those who spend lot of time infront of Computer,"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.

Poor aftersales support.",3,4
Value for money,"When the product arrived, it was sealed in a thick box and multiple layers of plastic. But eventually when I got to the sealed tape, I found it had already been broken apart. I decided to test out the monitor instead of returning the opened box and that was the mistake I did. After 10 days, the top half of the screen on the monitor became dimmer and duller for no reason. There is absolutely nothing great about this monitor to write about.",3,4
Be careful when you buy this monitor!,"Got this monitor after going through almost a week of research. Wanted to buy the LG 24"" as the Samsung curved one has a VA panel and I have seen it, the colors were not that great in that one but at the last moment I saw this from Samsung. My expectations were high from Samsung and it did match my expectations.
Pros:
1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.
3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.
4. The thin bezels gives it a modern look.
Cons:
1. The stand is not adjustable, I didn't expect it to have adjust hight option, but at least adjusting the inclination angle option should be there for an monitor.

But it's a great buy at this price point. I got it for 9999. You can go for it. Everything else is really good in this one.

Edit: after using it for 6 months, I am impressed with the picture quality and colour reproduction. I didn't face any issues till date. I was so impressed that I got another one to have dual monitor setup :).",9,4
Awesome Monitor!,"Picture quality and viewing angles are awesome, frame less design looks great, but stand is not adjustable and backlight bleeding is there, replaced, and the new one also has bleeding

The best budget Full HD IPS Monitor,"I have been using this monitor for a week now, primarily for work and a little bit of gaming, and I am quite impressed by what it offers for the price (I got it for 8500 during prime day).

Pros:
1. Deep blacks give great contrast ratio
2. Matt finish minimizes reflections
3. Freesync and 75hz are good additions for gaming
4. Very slim bezels on 3 sides

Cons:
1. No vertical height adjustment
2. Color accuracy could be better out of the box. It is apparent in the pic where you can see the difference in green color of the leaves on the laptop screen and the monitor. But since i am not doing any color sensitive work, I found it acceptable.",13,3
"Its a good monitor, but you get what you pay for.","I think this is not a IPS display as there is no mention of IPS on the box nor in the manual and description.

After a Little bit of research i came to know that Samsung has its own version of IPS technology and it is called PLS technology which is very similar to IPS hence i got very similar image quality.

Overall inshort:
Pros:
1) Punchy Colors.
2) Contrasty image (some may not like).
3) Wide Viewing angle.
4) 75 Hz refresh rate (72Hz freesync on).
5) No Backlight Bleeding.
6) Really thin bezel for price.
7) One Joystick botton to control all features.
8) Cable hook provided in box for cable management.
9) Quite good design.
10) Blacks are quite good not best.

Cons :
1) It is little bit pixelating kinda okayish as its 24 inch but higher than 24inch it might get worse.
2) No height adjustment only tilt feature.
3) I think its not as colour accurate as IPS because image looks quite punchy maybe you have to adjust setting for accuracy.
4) No one tap button Power off as its a two step process.
5) No onscreen software control available.
6) No audio out from display.
7) Stand is glossy and matte plastic combo which is okayish.
8) Only HDMI and Sub DVI no Display port.

By the way it can be overclocked to 83Hz max and HDMI cable is provided in box.

Overall good Monitor for its price as i bought it at ₹9500.",4,3
One of the best budget monitor,"Pros.

1. Samsung screens doesn't need a intro. Even other mobile manufacturer's are buying screens from samsung only. So screen quality is top notch😍.

2. It is a IPS panel, viewing angles good. Inky black. Good contrast. Great brightness. No backlight issue most important to choose this.

3. Comes with hdmi cable and power cable. No VGA anyhow I don't need that, but if you need you have to buy it separately.

4. Installation is easy and wall mountable. Planning to make it as a second tv after WFH over 😝

Cons.
Price again it is not a cons. Would have been great if it is little cheaper.

Overall great purchase and good Monitor",5,3
Okay with a couple of issues,"This display is classic Samsung. Contrast-y, bright and sharp. The actually frequency is 72.9 Hz whereas advertised as 75 Hz.
The picture modes are good and offers a dedicated Game Mode - where all the sliders are maxed out.
The FreeSync is a boon, it improves the ghosting observed and minimizes any screen-tearing.
The fixture is robust and looks sleep, except there is a slight screen wobble when I types at my max speed.
The cable management behind is good and the included HDMI cable is a welcome.
The bezels are stunning and movies/games look seamless.

I like the display, 9/10.",3,3
This comes with 16A power plug!,"Good monitors, I bought 2 monitors for a better dual screen experience. Although this is basil less, the black edging is significantly lower compared to the other monitors I've used at work.

The backlight bleeding is very less , Infact it's the best of what I've seen so far. (photo attached has reflection)

The viewing angles are great. I do not see much difference in color when looked at the display from the sides.
The monitor automatically selects input devices. Can be controlled in the setting menu
Over all, for 9k -10k this is a good monitor for the price range

Works great. Less one star as the colour needs to be calibrated.,"A great external monitor that's just the right size for day to day office work and occasional Netflix/ Prime viewing. Was looking for a monitor to help manage working from home and the increased need for an additional monitor to help with screen share / presentation etc.

Need a little tweak to make this really great.

When this was plugged in at 1st, the text were awful and no matter what I tried to do with the settings nothing seemd to work. Finally after playing with the settings options on the monitor (not via Windows OS) figured out that setting the 'Game Mode Always On' did the trick. The text is razor sharp and smooth transition when you drag and drop windows and other apps. Most of the other settings were kept at factory setting. Monitor is very very bright at 100%. Recommended to dial it down to 20-25%. Hope this helps if you are struggling with the resolution.",3,3
Value monitor,"Great product! Got it at Rs.9499 without any offers. Package arrived in 1 day. Eco friendly packing. Monitor has eye saver mide which is great and brightness can be increased or reduced as per comfort. Looks nice of the while and display is problem free.
I didnt see any noticable light leakage in the screen edges as some posts say. Probably its miniscule.",4,3

Disappointed with the reviews and the product,"due to COVID - 19 my office instructed to WFH for few weeks and I need an office like setup at home for my busy workday. Bought couple of these monitors and an Amazon Basics dual monitor stand for mounting these monitors. The whole setup compliments my office desk.

Pros:
- Matty finish (good for programming / development use)
- 75Hz refresh rate
- LED backlight (night time you can some light bleeding, but during day time / under proper light no difference)
- VA Panel (no details about VA / IPS panel either in the documentation or Samsung website)
- Colour reproduction is awesome
- Mount option available
- Frameless Design (looks great)

Cons:
- No Audio out port (as mentioned by others). You can't use it for other use cases (like tv)
- Limited connectivity options (no DVI / DisplayLink port), only HDMI or VGA
- VGA resolution is not good when on MAC (I tested Mac Book Pro only, don't know about others). HDMI is recommended

Need to check the durability.",One,3
Terrible after sales service in Chennai,This is one of the best displays that I've came across at this price range. The only problem is that you cannot adjust height of the display like most monitors.,9,2
Not for office work if you use terminal,"CONS (only 2):

1.
Viewing Angles are NOT OK.

Of course it is not an IPS panel. If it's an IPS, there will be a clear logo. There is no mention of the same on official product specs either. It could be a PLS panel.

2.
Gaming modes: 75 hz. Useless, just marketing. No difference at all. Note: My testing was based on a dedicated graphics card with appropriate settings. Max output was 72 hz. Beyond that, screen will blankout, become non compatible. However, you will not find any difference compared to 60hz and 75hz. Maybe you will see a difference if you place the panel under a microscope or some highend slow motion camera purely for purpose of panel testing. Its just a marketing myth (irrespective of brands). You can find significant difference from144hz onwards.

PROs:

NO BACKLIT BLEEDING across the screen. I tested with a pitch black image file with full brightness settings and various angles in a dark room environment. So no issues at all.

Panel is matt finish, so no screen glares to an extent.

Color reproduction is very vibrant. Somewhat 70% close to HDR 400 although its not a HDR screen.

Overall Build quality, fit and finish is excellent. Very slim bezel with simple modern design and appeal.

9.5 K is an excellent price.

Package and delivery was good.",5,2
3.5 out of 5.,"I have been using a 27"" LG 4K IPS primary monitor that costs 40K+ and a cheap 20"" Samsung TN secondary monitor. The secondary monitor has been showing some signs of old age, and needed a replacement. What I wanted was an affordable monitor that had reasonable picture quality and over all build quality.

To be honest, I only expected an average performer in this monitor, and was pleasantly surprised by it's image quality. The colours are vibrant (don't expect the quality you get from a premium monitor) and it has more than enough brightness.

My premium primary monitor, while having excellent colour reproduction and pixel density suffers from shoddy quality control - I had to replace it five times in the span of 18 months due to various issues ranging from terrible backlight bleeding, colour non-uniformity and image retention. So when bought this rather cheap Samsung monitor, my expectations were not that high. But it outperformed my expectations. For the asking price, this is a steal.

The good:
1. Adequate image quality and colour reproduction. Bear in mind that it is not factory calibrated.
2. Excellent blacks - Even though Samsung says it is an IPS panel, I suspect that it is indeed a VA panel, because I have never seen an IPS panel that is able to render such deep blacks as this monitor does.
3. Really good brightness
4. Relatively lightweight
5. Almost no bezels
6. Adequate viewing angles
7. The VESA mount bracket is on level with the surface, unlike some LG monitors where the VESA screws area is depressed which would make it incompatible with some VESA mounts.
-----
* The pros listed below this point are specific to my monitor, and may not hold true for every one as these things are dependent on QC and is based on your luck.
6. Only extremely minor backlight bleeding - so minor that you'd often fail to notice it. My 40k+ LG monitor has major backlight bleeding issues. So this is a major relief for me.
7. No image retention issues
8. Excellent Black and White uniformity. Grey uniformity is only average.

Cons:
1. The included stand is of low quality. It has sharp rough edges and mold marks.
2. Tilt is very difficult to execute. You have to apply a lot of force to tilt the monitor, sometimes I felt worried that I might damage the monitor.
3. Not so great pixel density. Being only a 1080p monitor, 24"" size makes the pixels too big which force you to stay a bit farther away, otherwise the text does not look smooth. This is not a problem for watching videos or playing games.
------
* Following cons are specific to the monitor I received and other devices may not have these issues
4. Dead pixels - Mine had 5 dead pixels which were prominently around the top right corner. I wasn't bothered by those though.

NOTE:
When I first turned on the monitor I experienced some contrast related issues. The monitor was unable to render certain shades of grey and looked indistinguishable from white. It turned out that this was caused by the setting 'Black level' - mine had it set to 'Low', and once I changed it to 'Normal' the issue was gone.",2,2
"Good, but there is flicker issue sometimes.","So, my first attempt of buying this product was not good. The monitor had screen bleeding after few hours of use itself. Returned and got a replacement.
Pros:
Love the look, design and curve around the edges
No screen bleeding with the replaced monitor
Display is good
Overall happy with the price point and product.

Cons:
Stand is not adjustable
The button is on the backside which was difficult to find at first and not so great to use
Brightness level is too much even if I decrease it to a minimum, but I have got used to it now after few days.

Overall, worth to buy especially for the price compared to the competition",3,2
Monitor is good but customer service is nil,"Bought it as my second monitor.
Big enough for normal office works. Have played FPS games and the experience is decent.

Steal at 9000/-

"There is no option to reduce Brightness, though blue light is filtered.","Rcvd the product very fast.
Negative Things:
1. Screen Is fixed type you cant not adjust it horizontal or vertical.
2. While connecting with laptop as second screen refresh rate gets only 71.90HZ, contacted customer care, reply rcvd as extending the display across your screen and tv then you will of course experience a bit of a decrease in performance.

Only the good thing got it in 8500rs in amazon sale.",Helpful,2
Good Monitor but NOT the Best,"Monitor color looks good.
No edge bleeds.

Monitor stand is firm, but very annoying problem it looks little bit tilted towards front side, and I cannot adjust it as it's not adjustable. But if you don't pay much attention then it doesn't bother much.

I'm going to keep this one, already returned 1 monitor for defects.

Colors looks little yellowish with default settings. I decreased RED and GREEN little bit now looks OK.

I'll post later if any problem I face later.",2,2
Good Monitor with few cons,"I purchased this at ₹10300. Product feels vibrant. Comes with eyesaver mode if you want to enable. Led is very bright I'm using at 20% brightness. Also clarify confusion, it has vertical tilt available.
Yes a little bit black bleeding is there. But its manageable and it won't bother when you are using the screen.",Helpful,2
Review after 39 months 2 days,This is a great monitor. I switched from 19.5 and this feels huge compared to that. The picture quality is very good and watching videos is an absolute delight. It also has a vesa mount for hooking it on stands or wall. Its not really thin compared to some of hp monitors at that price but it feels sturdy. But the stand takes quite a lot of space and is spread out and its overall a bit heavy,One,2
too bright and enough contrast.,"The product is having major backlight bleeding.

Lacks basic connectivity,I bought this samsung S24R356FHWXXL 24 inch monitor and Its build Quality was nice. But one problem I found was its color was not accurate and giving bluish green shade. so It affects my designing work and I requested return. So as per their policy they replaced it with another monitor same model. But the problem was still there. so again returned and I gone for Benq monitor. It gave me very good color accuracy and satisfied with the result :),185,1
Brightness uniformity is terrible," I purchased this monitor for 9599/- Issues with small backlight bleeding, purchased despite similar reviews as it’s on sale. This monitor (Samsung monitor- L side) is not even worth compared to my Older 9k worth Monitor(Acer Nitro on right ). They both has same configuration with 75Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time and AMD freesync.
But my monitor on left (Acer Nitro-R) has more smoothness and more stylish. Build quality is similar at both.",38,1
Horizontal pixel lines and flickering problem came in just 1 week for 2 monitors,"Looks elegant but otherwise an ordinary LED Monitor though of recent ( 2021 ) make as per the box. Not the top in the class technology one associates with a renowned brand name like Samsung. The JOG button at the bottom rear is neither convenient to access not easy to operate. Also chance of damaging the JOG button by blindly inserting the fingers from front and operating it. Once the 'Eye saver Mode' is on, it is better to set / change display using using the ""Display"" setting in your computer using mouse/key pad. The stand is rigid and no tilting down or back is possible. Use a faster HDMI cable instead of the one provided.",29,1
No standard monitor power cable and HDMI. Cannot use.,"I thought I'd use it as a secondary, vertical monitor beside my primary 27"" WQHD IPS. I couldn't stand it.

The panel is not that great, very little headroom to tweak it to display accurate colors. Cannot even set gamma manually, just some presets. Then, the PPI is also low enough to look unpleasant. Samsung claims it's an IPS, but I suppose it barely makes the cut.

Find something better for your money.",44,1
good monitor..but damaged easily and unsatisfactory after sales service,"Text from far looks good but if you are using it upclose this won't cut it. I have a macbook pro, i think i might be spoiled by those crips display. It's not atall a bad panel but for my use case i might save up to buy a 2k or 4k panel, 1080p ain't cutting it.",18,1
Not for programming,"This is a good piece at this range with the reputed samsung branding and LED panel.

2. Have samsung black mode gives oled panel like deep black.
3. Good overlooks

Cons:
1. Have IPS glow like other panels
2. Need auto calibrated colours
3. Eye staining
4. Stand is too cheap
5. Joystic button is low qualitied should be in the middle
6. Hinge is too tight",19,1
"Just another average monitor, with defects in manufacturing process","Its is really a good monitor in the price Range, but cant adjust the height or neither can be tilted.
Picture quality is really amazing.

The monitor I got had too much IPS glow from bottom (clearly seen in night) and had few dead pixels. so, I had to return it.

Sometimes my eyes were hurting on watching this monitor, although brightness, contract was at the minimum level.
For Dual WFH home setup, yes its good, make sure that the monitor is placed 3 feed approx from your sitting place to get a decent view and not hurt your eyes.

BIG Power plug DOES NOT fit in most Indian power sockets,"The pic quality is good, but there are two improvements required
- The stand of the monitor is fixed and tilted towards front.it could not be adjusted even by 1 degree.

"Got defected product, saw the defect after 2 weeks of use","For a limited time usage this is fine.
But for a user with more than 4 hours of daily usage, this monitor is a worse idea. Its been 4 months since I bought this monitor. At times it was difficult to keep using screen because of the blue lights may be, I tried to switch to eye comfort mode, but that was a big lie. The continues usage of this screen made my eyes hurt when I use it in night light.

Screen resolution of FHD compared to 24"" is not good according to my experience. FHD is should be maximum to 21.5"". The experience may differ to lot of other people. I'm so keen on having better experience from what I buy.

The next thing I wanted to say is, there's a father's dirt kind of visibility in the monitor. Either the quality testing was an absolute crap or mistake from the quality testing team or it would have been damaged due to some fungus or anything like that.

About the refresh rates of the screen, its not that good. If you are listening so close you'll be able to see the trace of shadow on sudden movements. That's something what makes you uncomfortable ask the way. Its like iron powder following a magnet. Not a good experience.

Decent quality monitor in 24inch monitor.,"Old model (LCD Technology) and New model (LED Technology) is the exact same price.

I ordered the newer model of the monitor and received an older model. Within 1 hr asked the Customer service team No: 1
to change my monitor they couldn't help they openly said they can't do any changes to my order and cannot do refund or exchanges.

They are playing with words that mentions 7 day replacement but that's puts where there is other wordings like warranty so people mistake them

Team 2 of customer service came on the phone and they said they can help and guess what they ordered a replacement of the same model and serial number. That's not the way Customer service work. Why would I need the same model and serial number replaced again when I have the same thing in my home delivered about 1 hr ago.

3rd Team said they cannot order the newer model and cannot do a exchange and cannot do a refund of the money as well.

So basically I should keep what I ordered and paid.

I shouldn't have bought it in Amazon to be honest just useless team and if they can't help the client who has paid 10K for a monitor they should be bothered about clients going to other E platform sites.",26,4

Review after using 2 weeks,"This is a question which I had while purchasing it and after receiving the product - Is it an LCD or an LED monitor?
Well, the short answer is it's an LCD monitor. It only has LEDs as the backlighting as an LCD needs a light source to work.
I bought it for just less than 9k, so it's very competitively priced... at least by the seller.
In the box, received an HDMI cable as well, of approx. 1.5m or 4.5ft length and the quality of both these, the screen as well as the hdmi cord, seem to be quite good. The picture quality is very good with good adjusting capabilities of brightness, contrast , blue light and all the other good stuff. It has 3 ports in the back - hdmi, vga and aux.
One thing I did notice is that the power adapter doesn't seem to be genuinely acer's. The box was sealed by acer, so I think that Acer is using some cheap chinese adapter to save costs, but if that doesn't cause an issue, it doesn't bother me.",Helpful,3

A decent buy,"First of all, I am not a professional. I use this monitor only for movies, videos and office. Very occasionally amateur photo editing. Did not use it for gaming. I used this monitor with mac mini(2018) and hp spectre. I did a lot of research before making this purchase. To sum up what I found out and my personal experience: This is an entry level 4k monitor. There are some 4k monitors which are cheaper than this, but they come with TN panel. The picture quality is great no doubt, but I found a few things a bit disappointing - Only 300 nits. For this price I feel atleast 350, if not 400 would be great. A little bit of glare. And finally, HDR. In my research I came to understand that this monitor 'supports' HDR, but it is not VESA certified DisplayHDR. You can find the list of HDR certified products online. In fact a different model 27UL600 has DisplayHDR 400 certification. I did play some HDR content that I have and I was disappointed a bit. But the resolution is excellent. I felt that the response time is a bit slow when I use this with mac mini.
Anyway overall, very satisfied. If your budget allows, prefer the next models like 27UK650 or 27UL600, as they are HDR certified and have some international recognition.",Helpful,4
Okay-ish!,"Bought this at Rs 28,994.
I have just been using this monitor for the past 2 hours since it's delivery.
To experience refresh rates of 60hz or higher, the HDMI interface won't cut it. You will need to use the Display Port interface.

I am using a 2015 13inch Mac Book Pro. I had pre-ordered a mini DPI to DPI cable along with the monitor so as to connect using the Mac's Thunderbolt port.

This is what I am using. https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B013PWQPFS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 if you want to experience 4K in all its glory.

This same mini DP cable works with my office provided Lenovo T470. Most WinTel laptops come with at least a mini DP.

For later generation Macs, Thinkpads, those with a USB-C type interface, you will need this cable

On a Mac, all text is crisp and clear. With a PPI that is almost Retina Level Quality. Honestly, the difference in clarity between the Mac Book Pro's retina screen Vs this LG screen is negligible and is probably only because the former is a smaller 13-inch display.

I will also attach a few Windows Screenshots as well.",One,4

I had to lower the brightness as it was causing strain. I am using a HDMI cable with 60Hz RR but no HDR without a DP.",Helpful,4
Amazing monitor at this price,"This is my first monitor and I got a 4k monitor. The product is amazing. I am lucky I got a new package and 1 days delivery. The good thing with LG is it provides multiple cables including HDMI, DPI. Earlier I purchased a Acer 32"" 2k monitor. It was too big and eyes were paining to read text in such a big monitor which is not 4K. So, I decided to get 27"" and I chose LG. I felt the difference. You can read all day long with 4K display without discomfort to your eyes and watching movies on this display is amazing. I use it with my MacBook Air 2017 model. You should buy a miniDPI to DPI port cable. I spent another 1000 rupees for it but it worked well. Thank you, team Amazon!

Thanx Amazon this product is very good and good working love am using 1 month later,"The picture quality is amazing with this 4K UHD monitor. Mind only one thing, before buying this or any 4K monitor make sure that your motherboard or graphics card has the latest HDMI port that support 4k at 60hz or higher. Some graphics cards also can't handle 4K, so before purchase make sure that your system is compatible. If your mother board is cheap quality and doesn't have good HDMI port, it may cause problem while using 4K.",Helpful,4
Ok,"I am very pleased with this 4K monitor. It does not have USB connectivity (i.e. a USB hub); it does not have a height adjustable stand. Having those would have been nice, but that would also add to the price.

Good for multitasking.,"This is one of the budget monitor for a non-gamer who wants a 4K resolution for day 2 day tasks. Use Display port at monitor end to get 4K@60HZ. (i brought a USB-c to Display converter for additional 3K to connect my Laptop (both Apple Mac and Dell)). Use HDMI for full HD only for better results (using HDMI for my second dell 24 inch FullHD monitor)
Using it for mostly switching btw office work, Watching movies, Photo-edits using Photoshop. Having been using it for 1 week and feel color accuracy is 80% Ok. HDR is not the best but still does job during Movies.
The stand is pretty useless (no vertical/horizontal move (buy 27UK650). Just vertical tilt). Use a 100x100 vest mount based monitor desk mount for more friendly move and use.",One,3
Good product in budget.,"This monitor is okay, its decent, since its a IPS display colors are good. 4k resolution at 27 inch looks very sharp. We dont have much options at the price range of 30K, So here is what i think about pros and cons

Pros :
- Decent Monitor for under 30K
- Great Colors
- Superb Response Time
- Great Viewing Angles
- Freesync support , lot of color preset options
- 2 hdmi 2.0 and 1 display port with a great stand
- Very good size to resolution ratio, perfect for 4k gaming on consoled and pc

Cons
- HDR is just a checklist checked, Very poor HDR since it is a 8 bit+FRC panel
- HDR just makes everything grayish and pinkish and looks dull . Tried all settings and compared it with a sony hdr tv. This monitor has a very poor HDR implemenation .
- Poor Contrast Ratio , Dark Scenes dont look good. But there are no VA panels at this price as well
- Not a 10 bit panel , thats a bummer ...
- Under 400 nits of brightness is another reason for poor HDR , though 400 nits is bright enough when u sit upclose.

What could have made it great... ?
If LG can pull a 10 bit panel with a good contrast ratio over 1000:1 and retain all Pros i mentioned , this monitor would be a steal at 30K. Though for HDR local dimming zones , high brightness over 600 nits is essential, a 10 bit panel would have made this monitor look great in HDR.

If you are fine with poor HDR , and hdmi 2.1 monitors are still years away, this would still a great a buy for your consoles and pc.",One,3
Good for home use,The monitor is awesome; has lots of preset levels for display and just perfect size for a 4x2 table for a work from home setup. This version has fixed stand and hence needs a VESA mount-clamp in order for height adjustment and tilt. Overall no complaints and been using since Mar-20 and its great !! Price is on a higher side compared to Samsung and Benq which you can get for 5K less.,Helpful,3
Okay,"Absolutely lovely product. Prior to this I tried LG 29UM69g in which the text was pixelated so had to return it. The text sharpness in this is brilliant, I use it with Macbook Pro 2015, must say the text is as good as retina display. Anyone thinking of it for home office, you will definitely love it too.

The only con I could find after using it for a week now is, it comes with HDMI cable but it only supports 30 fps rather than 60. This is the downside of it. Of course we can purchase the cable but what's the point of providing it with low rate than the monitor's capability. LG should address it.",Helpful,3
Affordable price.,"As this is my first 4K monitor I was mesmerized by it's display after watching 4K video at 60fps. I was using a LG 22"" display before so this 27"" inch display seems quite huge but at the same time comfortable , don't have to turn head which I think might be a problem with 32"" display.

I think it's a great investment for someone spending a lot of time on screen as the resolution is soothing to eyes and very much comfortable for long hours of work.

Pros-
-Picture Quality is amazing
- Good reading mode
-Delivered in less than 24 hours (Thanks Amazon)

Cons(No major flaws )
Fixed stand - No Screen Rotation /height adjustable (Not much big of an issue)
Screen little wobbly because of the stand , It will be fine if the table is fixed and firm",Helpful,3
good,"I originally bought one which wobbled a lot, but after buying a second one (needed for my work) and marrying them up together reduced / removed the wobble. Screen clarity is good - I work in relatively dark conditions due to the type of work I do (media) so massive brightness wasn't required. After a little calibration, both screens are performing well with no issues. Run it through display port to get the true 60Hz.

In a nutshell, I had a choice, spend rs60k on replacing my MacBook screen due to flexgate or buy 2 4k screens. I went for the latter and have been happy with the result..!",Helpful,3
Over all Good,"The peak brightness is too low to truly enjoy HDR content. But, otherwise, the display is great. No complaints. I played around with the software that LG provides that splits the screen into different zones and allows sharing of mouse and keyboard between computers, etc. I didn't really need it for my purposes, so I didn't spend too much time on it, but I can totally see someone relying on that for their setup/workflow.",Helpful,3

"Good, but can't expect much","The monitor looks old with its white back and big black plastic bezel. But switch it on and the 4K with HDR display is very good and you will quickly forget about the rest of the monitor design.

Product is okay for casual work. However not recommended for higher expectations.,"1. Good picture quality
2 text is smooth just like in a retina display (use appropriate zoom level). Device pixel ratio is 2 which is great for smooth text.
Note : buy usb c to display port or usb c to hdmi 2 or greater to get 4k @60hz, otherwise you only get 30hz refresh rate.

The cable come with this monitor is hdmi 1.4 which is poor, only support 4k @30hz. LG should address this.",One,2
Average monitor,"This model is ‘ok’ at best. Nothing spectacular about this product. Picture quality seems good, but extremely thick bezels like a 2010 model. Looks are extremely bad, I got bored even in first day. Brightness is meh, just not good enough. Nothing specially good in this monitor.
The HDMI cable can’t support 4K@60fps. You need display port for that.
Few other points to consider:
- Works with MacBook pro , you get full 4K resolution. But like I mentioned only 30fps through HDMI.
- The monitor shakes quite a bit, the stand is not very sturdy. A light movement shakes the monitor. May want to invest on VESA mount if you want.
- The cable length is decent, Easily more than 2m.
- The monitor control is via a small 'joy stick', it's made of plastic and flimsy.
- The control interface/software of monitor is old-school style. The design of software is not that appealing.
- Didn't face any flickering so far.",Helpful,2
Decent monitor,"It's kind of okay, found one dead pixel and 4K@60hz over hdmi only if your laptop supports hdmi v2.0.
And I am pretty suspicious that this piece was used once because of the packaging and even the driver CD was not in the packaging, it was roaming open in the box and got all scratches on it.
Edges of the panel seems like they are not fitted properly but that's my view, maybe that's how they do it.

Poor quality and bed result,"Within a day I felt my eyes are paining because of the quality issue of this product.
This is not a true IPS, thought spec has it. It is only as an advanced TN panel.
Reason -
1. The color quality of the picture is varying in the non-straight angles. Only the center viewing angle colors are sharp/bright and the not-straight angle is graying depending on the variance of the angle. Higher the angle, higher is the graying.
2. The backlight bleeding is so high, my Sony Bravia HD IPS TV (2015 model - W series) does better than this monitor. FYI - I have compared this side-by-side.
3. This is gone be the first and last LG product which I have purchased, reason - the item cannot be returned due to bad quality. The replacement will be the same product. I don't know if Amazon can help. I don't even dream that the company will accept this feedback into consideration and will give me an upgraded model as a replacement to sort the quality issue. (God = AWS- help my eyes!)
4. I had wonderful LG panel reviews in my ears for years before I landed upon this. Practically, you are not able to maintain it or maybe like i-donot-care about the quality anymore. Plz LG, not just me but we all believe you have been leading the market with great products and innovation. Plz, continue to do so. Your monitors/TVs were great too!
5. Of course, this monitor is good enough for bright color but dull or dark, very bad. I am a heavy computer user, I prefer dark mode/theme of Apps/software to reduce the eye stress during the night time. On this monitor, I avoid using the dark mode/themes. If I have too, then another eye stress comes. So this monitor is only good for me in the day time :) (I lost my 50% money ;p ). If I use them then clarity of dark color fonts/symbols is an issue and I have to change the angle to work on it, which means move to a straight angle to see the objects cleary.

Not good for his price,"Connecting this LG monitor to a Macbook Pro (2016) with a Cable Matters displayport to usb-c cable will sometimes not show anything on the external monitor. Per LG CS, LG does not recommend using cables that converts one format to another. In this case LG only wants you to connect display port to display port or HDMI to HDMI. Otherwise they cannot guarantee that it will always work. This also happens with the same setup at work (albeit older model LG, but same specs) and different brand cable.

The issue here I think is that the os gets confused as to what's connected to the computer so the usbc port is displaying somewhere in a parallel monitor universe and something within the config needs to be reset. This happens when you wake up your computer from sleep or switching from one monitor to the next. At work, we constantly connect and disconnect monitors - when going to conference rooms and back to our desks. So this is really a setup that has to work 99.999% of the time. Otherwise it gets frustrating having to restart your computer.

Your monitor is fine - its not broken. This works all the time with my HDMI port equipped Macbook Pro 2012. When connecting the LG Monitor > HDMI > Apple HDMI/usbc adapter > Macbook during the issue you will get a green screen with a fat cursor - see attached picture. Waiting overnight sometimes helps, sometimes doesnt. USBc monitors are still out of my price range so this will have to do. I'll be happy if LG fixes this, but not holding my breath and hesitant to recommend.",Helpful,1

"Bulky and below par, bad customer support from Amazon to resolve the issue","I bought this as a second monitor so I could work at home. I need a lot of screen real estate and I thought the larger size and 4k resolution might help with that.
What's good:
screen size is good
brightness and clarity are great
color is rich

What's bad:
This monitor has been a little flaky from the start. At first I blamed my PC, but I'm now convinced it's the monitor.
I often have to unplug it and plug it back in to get picture to show up after I've been logged off a while. The power button doesn't seem to function in that circumstance.
If you've never had a 4k monitor, mouse accuracy is speed can be aggravating. I've done several adjustments, but going from my laptop to my screen just never quite translates. Not the monitors fault, but something to think about.
Check your video card compatibility (this varies by monitor)... I've had some issues with random back and forth resizing.

Worthy,"This monitor has some serious issues.

I used it with my MacBook Pro as an external monitor, while the colors were all nice and vibrant but there’s something wrong.

Before starting I’d like to tell all, I am no gamer. I am just an IT professional.

The monitor was lagging a lot, I also tried using the display port cable to get 60 fps but that didn’t resolve the issue as well.

The thing is Mac will scale it down to 1080p by default, that causes a lot of noticeable lag like when you are opening new windows, minimizing, maximizing.

If you change the resolution to 3840x2160, the lag is gone but then everything becomes so small that its impossible to read.

I almost got irritated with it and that’s when I decided to return it.

I have a Hp 24es monitor, its 1080p with IPS Panel. It works butter smooth with my MacBook also the quality difference is unnoticeable. Shocking this is that is less than half of what this monitor costs.

Good product at a great price,"The colour reproduction is not accurate, which is expected for an eye care monitor. It is excellent for reading and office work; increases productivity by providing large screen real estate.

I am running it over HDMI with my gaming-laptop, so 4K is available only at 30 Hz. At 30 Hz refresh rate the monitor is unusable, so I have to run it at 1440p resolution to get 60Hz. I believe this is a limitation of most 4K monitors on the market. Unless you have a GPU which can connect to it through display port, do not consider a 4K monitor.

I cannot be sure if the response time is 1 ms, but the monitor has no detrimental effect on gaming performance. If gaming is the priority, then obviously 4K is not the way to go and consider at least a 120Hz monitor.

The speaker sound quality is horrible, and the volume is low. There is only tilt adjustment and no height adjustment, but the stand is heavy to support the monitor. The thick bezels make it look like an ancient device, but the whole construction is sturdy enough. Again this monitor is not worth the consideration if looks are important.

This monitor is a great choice if utility is the priority, but it is definitely not worth the MRP of ₹ 42,800 and a bit on the expensive side at the current discounted price of ₹ 27,300.",Helpful,3

Broken stand,"I have been using this monitor for casual/light gaming with a mid-range graphics card and AMD Ryzen 5. I think this is worth mentioning because this monitor supports AMD Freesync.

Also, I have been using a DP cable for connection. More on this later.

PROS:

1. Amazing peak brightness. Colours look true out of the box without any tweaking. There are however a few useful picture modes.

2. The Brightness Intelligence Plus feature which adjusts the glare according to the ambient light in the room works pretty well for my application and my surroundings. Your mileage may vary.

3. Relatively easy on the eyes even after extended gaming/work hours. Please note this is relative to a normal, price-efficient and generic monitor. (Oh, and please take frequent breaks and take care of your health!)

4. This is my first 4K screen experience ever. 4K content looks pretty good & crisp. 1080p even better.

5. I also use a 4K streaming box with this monitor. The viewing experience is as good as/better than a TV. (Of course, at a proper viewing distance as this is a 28-inch screen)

6. Viewing angles are great for both text and videos. Personally, I did not see any issue with this.

CONS:

There a few cons which could be a deal-breaker for you. Please read on.

1. The HDR 10 experience isn't that great. Do not buy this monitor merely for an HDR experience or you will be left disappointed.

The major issue with HDR being blacks aren't consistent and colours can become choppy during some dark scenes. This was a major turnoff for me and I wish it were better. HDR just doesn't look good.

2. I had to switch to a DisplayPort cable for the best experience after trying multiple HDMI cables with my desktop setup as mentioned above.

With HDMI, the display flickered even after changing cables and getting expensive ones. Not sure if this was a one-off issue.

Hence, I suggest using a DP cable if you are using a midrange or higher spec PC for the best results.

However, the display works fine with a laptop connected with an HDMI cable. I did not see any issues with a laptop. Reason unknown!

Conclusion: This is a decent buy for a 4K display intended for casual gaming, office work and great for 4K media consumption. Not if you are looking for a good HDR display. Also worth noting that the refresh rate is maxed out at 60 Hz with drops to be expected at higher than 1080p.

Hope this helps. Please feel free to ask any questions in a comment below.

Dark shades at the sides.,"I have been using this monitor since a month for Gaming, Office work and for Media Consumption. Its a good 4k monitor for the price.
Pros: It has great build quality, has brightness intelligence which adjusts the screen brightness according to room lighting conditions. Supports Amd vrr. Inbuilt speaker is an added bonus.
Cons: This monitor is not ideal for watching movies. Don't get me wrong, its decent, but when the room light is bright, colors feels washed out especially if u compare with other brighter panels. Monitor looks great when you use it in the night. Brightness Intelligence icon at the bottom is too big and it distracts as it keeps popping up every few seconds.",Helpful,2
Just for home use and quality is not so good,"Like: The screen display is very sharp and letters are as legible as if they are printed. 28"" screen size is more than adequate, it has tapped holes at the back so that it can be mounted on the wall.
Dislike: (1) Its packing was damaged and it had a gaping hole in the face of the carton as you can see in the picture. Luckily (for the supplier) the product was not damaged. (2) Its sound volume output is so very low that even at 100% setting of the volume I can barely hear from 2 feet distance. I called service department but they raised their hands saying that it is BENQ standard and if you want higher volume I have to buy a set of speakers.",One,2
Pretty Decent product at this price point and its a LED backlit LCD monitor,"IMPORTANT: It is limited by HDMI 2.0 to reach its full potential and this cannot be fixed, doest not matter what Graphics card you have. It can do 4k but with compramises. The HDMI 2.0 lacks bandwith to support 60hz 10 bit HDR. So,10 bit hdr suffers at 4k.
Only DP 1.4 can over come this issue.

Good monitor for the INR 22k. No hight, tilt or swivel adjust thus lacks ergonomics. No built-in USB hub.",One,2
Low Quality - Aopen not Acer,"The display quality in terms of resolution is fantastic. However, the problem is with the viewing angles. If you look straight ahead at the center of the screen, at a perpendicular angle, the farthest pixels on either sides has an orange-ish tint to them. when move left and right while looking at the monitor, the color changes are blatantly noticeable. It looks like an LCD monitor rather than an LED monitor. It is described as LED on both amazon store page and on the product box. however, on the manual it says LCD. It does feel like an LCD monitor. So I returned the product and bought an Acer nitro 4K monitor, as I already have an Acer FHD monitor and it looks fantastic. I suggest you go for Acer monitor which priced about the same. Unless, you can get this monitor below 20k, don't buy it.",Helpful,2

Not Acer...selling with false brand name.,"I use a 16 inch macbook pro. When I decided to buy external monitor, I was concerned about
1. Will a FHD monitor fit same content that I see in my laptop or lesser (No use of external monitor if it display lesser content than your laptop)
2. Picture quality should be comparable

Review :
1. This LCD screen has decent colour image so ok if your work doesn't concern dark mode.
But for all coders or other people who prefer dark mode, this screen has unacceptable levels of light bleeding. So much so that at the upper end of screen you can't see the borders of chrome tabs and there is clear gradient from top to bottom. (See the images attached. They show how light bleed gradient spreads across screen)
2. Monitor is rated at 1.5A but for some weird reason ships with a 16A plug. You'll have to get separate socket fitted at your desk or get a 5to15A adapter.

Advice :
For all Mac users thinking of buying 4k monitors because of resolution parity : No, you don't need a 4K monitor, because although your mac's native resolution is 4K, at default scaling, it works at FHD resolution only. Therefore, if you use a FHD screen, the content displayed in your screen vs external monitor will be approx same (although more granular owing to pixel density diff. Macbook pro packs 4k resolution in only 16 inches !!!)

If you keep your mac at ""Default for Display"" resolution then -
1. A FHD monitor will give you approx same content in a bigger screen, although you'll see a relatively grainy image. If you can see 100 lines text on mac, you can see ~95-98 on FHD monitor
2. A 27/28 inch 4K screen set at native resolution can show you 4 times the info of mac, but it'll come at the cost of screen to content ratio. At 4K scaling on 27 inch screen, text becomes too small to read. You can't really use the 4k for text display purpose, you'll have to use ~WQHD/FHD scaled resolution to see any text properly.
3. For multimedia, yes, this monitor can render 4K videos. But where will you find them and do you have internet pack (speed + data limit) to support those? Majority of entertainment available commercially is streamed at FHD only. A FHD video watched at 3 feet distance on 27 inch screen or 6 feet distance on 55 inch screen seems detailed enough. Anything more than that seems too sharp to be pleasant.

Note : Macs allow for FHD external monitor @60Hz and 4K @30Hz connectivity. So, you'll notice the flicker and shoddy refresh rate in a 4K monitor even when moving the mouse cursor.",2,1
Poor side viewing visibility,"The TN panel used in this monitor is of a very poor quality, which makes the viewing experience a very unsatisfied one.

"Acer's fault not Amazon's, not sellers.","Ich habe nach einem Monitor für sowohl den PC als auch die PS4 Pro gesucht und entschied mich den BenQ EL2870U zu testen, da ich bereits gute Erfahrungen mit BenQ hatte. Als Benchmark diente mein alter BenQ XL2411Z.

Die Farbewiedergabe ist gut, es gibt zahlreiche Einstellungsmöglichkeiten am Monitor selbst, was ich sehr schätze, da bpsw. die PS4 keine bietet und am PC die Einstellungen im Control Panel von den Spielen teilweise verworfen werfen. Die UHD Auflösung sieht sehr gut und sauber aus.

HDR ist bei dem Monitor relativ sinnlos, da in den meisten Fällen die Helligkeit einfach nicht ausreicht. Bspw. Destiny 2 sieht schrecklich aus auf dem Monitor, genauso wie Call of Duty WW2. Ähnliches Problem hatte ich mit meinem alten TV, welche in HDR nur 400nits bot. Einzig God of War sah mit HDR auf dem Monitor toll aus, hell und mit satten Farben. Ich denke, dass es etwas mit der Implementierung zu tun hat, man muss ich aber darauf einstellen, dass bei 95% der Spiele HDR deutlich schlechter als SDR auf diesem Monitor aussehen wird. Am PC habe ich HDR mit Assassins Creed Origins testet, war ebenfalls nicht zu gebrauchen. Die Farbwiedergabe war gut, kam jedoch nicht an das Panel von meinem alten XL2411Z ran.

Zu guter letzt sind 60Hz für mich deutlich zu wenig, vor allem weil ich 144Hz gewohnt bin, aber das sollte jedem vorher klar sein. Für die Konosle würde sich der Monitor noch eignen, aber für den PC ist er für meinen Geschmack einfach zu langsam.

Ich habe dem Montiro 3 von 5 Sternen gegeben, weil er für den Preis einfach zuwenig bietet. Wer nach einem UHD Monitor mit 60Hz sucht, ist bei Samsung Modellen mit Quatum Dot Beschichtung und ohne HDR deutlich besser aufgehoben.",18,5

Think again before you buy.,"Three Faulty, in a row.",14,5
Its got a dead pixel!!!,"First and foremost, if you’re lucky enough to receive one that isn’t faulty I can confirm that the picture quality, along with the HDR setting is excellent and on paper the perfect monitor especially for console gaming (XboxOneX / PS4Pro)

However, somehow I managed to roll 3 faulty monitors in a row, the first being a simple dead pixel near the centre of the screen and to be honest it wasn’t the biggest deal as you could only see it on certain backgrounds but part of me felt put off as I had just forked our a fair amount of money for a brand new monitor, I should at least get all of the pixels that I payed for. Returned it and thanks to Amazon’s amazing customer support I received a replacement the next day - this one had no dead pixels, but after every 5 minutes or so white vertical lines would start fading over the screen which was extremely offputting especially mid-game. That one definitely had to go back, so third time lucky? Nope. This one worked fine for about an hour until I turned it off, the next day I couldn’t get the HDR to enable properly and it left everything looking extremely washed out and grey. I adjusted every setting in the manual and even contacted BenQ support but they told me that it’s an issue with some of the current HDR chips that are on the market and assured me they were working on a fix in the future.

Overall quite the headache but I really appreciate Amazons stellar service as always. I hope if you choose to purchase one of these you land on a gem and not a dud.",8,5

Good!,"Whatever you do, DON’T TURN ON HDR in PC display options!!",209,4
Amazon helped me in getting them repaired,"Posting this in case it helps out someone else who made the same devastating mistake I did... If you right-click on your desktop and select “Display”, you’ll notice a button saying “Turn on HDR for games and apps” - DON’T SWITCH THIS ON WITH THIS MONITOR!!!

Why? Because your BenQ screen will immediately go black and the settings will be saved into Windows default settings - meaning reconnecting the monitor multiple times will simply create the same black screen over and over...
Solution: You have to go into your registry and delete ALL folders beginning with “BNQ” inside the “Graphics Drivers” registry folder (note: there should be 4 of these) - this will reset the default display settings when connecting the monitor... In case you don’t already know this, tinkering with your registry is a seriously risky thing to do if you aren’t familiar with advanced PC stuff. So the fact that this was the only way I could solve the problem sends shivers down my spine!

As a budget 4k this monitor is fine, but only fine. It has VESA mounting holes which is what I was especially interested in, and 2xHDMI + 1xDisplayPort is useful. Calibrating the colours is very difficult, and it doesn’t help that the picture modes vary wildly and don’t all share the same control parameters.",96,4

Le HDR est une vaste blague, je ne sais pas comment BenQ à optenu la certification (pas sûr qu'il y en ai vraiment une ?) mais c'est tout simplement inutilisable.

Not up to Philips standards.,"I have two of these monitors. The first one was bought in late 2017 and I bought another one now. I work with a lot of Word, Text and PDF documents and it is easier if I can keep multiple screens open. All these days I was using the laptop screen + the external monitor as a dual screen set-up. But the laptop screen is quite small (13"" Toshiba Z30C), so I decided to invest in a second monitor. This review is for regular users (not gamers.)
[1] The main feature I love is the 'eye saver mode'. Considering that I use the monitors for 10 ~ 12 hours every day, I can feel the difference. When I use it in normal mode, I get eye strain. The reddish eye saver mode is quite effective.
[2] When connected with HDMI, the audio signal is also optionally output through the Headphone jack behind the monitor. Since I use my laptop as a CPU and prefer to keep it on a shelf, I can use wired headphones easily through the monitor port - quite useful.
[3] I run dual extended monitors - one connected via HDMI & one with VGA - both run at full HD (1920 x 1080) mode. The VGA connection will be a little fuzzy around the font edges, but given that VGA is analog signal, this is natural. Both are perfectly usable and if they were separate, I wouldn't even notice the fuzziness. But when they are right next to each other, I can make out the difference.
[4] The curvature of the monitor does not adversely affect image editing; it works perfectly fine. Straight-lines are still straight lines in any image editing software.
[5] Since VGA is becoming quite obsolete, some of the newer monitors have started dropping the VGA port. But it is quite useful, especially if your machine already has dual ports.

Only grouse : Compared to the previous edition that I bought in late 2017 (Same Model), there has been a little bit of cost cutting. Last time the box had HDMI + VGA cables. This time, the box only had the VGA cable.

My verdict : It is a good monitor and worth buying if you have to work with multiple screens.",6,1

"Waste of money and time, not good","I was in the market, looking for a large size monitor (22+ inches) when I came upon this one. This monitor was priced roughly the same as other monitors of the same size despite this being a curved one. Initially I was skeptical of getting the curved one wondering how it would look for my coding/writing purpose. Curved monitors are usually great for watching videos and movies etc bringing more depth and immersion into the experience however the use with text and graphical interfaces was unknown. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised that the monitor performed excellently even for this. Due to the size, you can fit in a lot of windows and sections of the IDE and you can read more lines of code at one go.

The weight is also quite less and the monitor is quite stable on its stand without any particular issues. The picture quality is excellent and one can't ask for a lot more at this price. Hence a full five-star for this.",8,1

Cheap build quality for a quality speaket,"You are lucky only if your system is AMD and supports ""Freesync"" technology because with freesync monitor goes up to 72 Hz frequency and then you can see a different quality of movie and game playing.

Tips for those who cannot set the monitor at optimized quality.

1) In monitor options set ""picture size"" to ""wide"".
2) In monitor options set ""freesync"" to ""Ultimate engine"" value and also turn on ""freesync"" in your graphic driver if it supports. Ignore these settings if your system doesn't support it.
3) Go to display adapter settings in windows and set monitor refresh rate to 72 Hz. You can only see 72 Hz option if you enable freesync.
4) In monitor settings set contrast to 65, Gamma to mode1 in color setting, Samsung magic upscale to mode1, eye saver mode to off, Game mode to off, Response Time to fastest, eco saving plus to low.
5) After finishing all these settings , restart your system.

Optional software for better video experience.

Download and install madVR renderer. Also download MPC-BE from sourceforge.net
Install MPC-BE , go to its options and set ""Video renderer"" to madVR in video options.
Disable all internal filters (Source filters, Video decoders , Audio decoders).
In External filters option click ""Add filter"" and select madVR.

Now play any Full HD movie or 4K movie in MPC-BE. Your mind will blow away with the quality.

Still I give all stars to Samsung monitor I purchased for office use. Display colors are good, resolution and brightness all are perfect.
I comes with VGA cable, not HDMI, hence I needed to buy separately. I liked that it has two pin power plug, as all computer power plugs are three pins.
It has four screw holes on the back so that it can be wall mounted on standard brackets.
It is simple to connect and use. Due to curved screen people give second look and like it.
Overall good screen and with stunning looks...",5,1
Philips fails.," Very beautiful monitor, perfect dimensions for me. Bought after lot of research during the lockdown and bough immediately it was lifted, found this value for money.
Already had a 21.5 inch Dell monitor which has now been converted to secondary extended desktop for my macbook pro.
Given that the WFH scene is gonna extend for long now, I think having such an extended monitor will help immensely esp for coding and multi-tasking.",7,5
"Replaced product was also defective, worst experience, very bad service","I was reading all the reviews for getting a fair idea of the monitor and was in a dilemma of buying it as the first 3 review had only 1 star but the almost 1100+ customers rating it to 4.5 stars so I thought of going for it.

There are some pros and cons mentioned below according to me. (Just after a day of usage)

Pros
1. Thin bezel
2. Viewing angle which is great (178 degree horizontal and 178 degree vertical). Hence you don't have any strain no eyes while viewing form different angles.
3. Wall mountable.
4. Anti glare
5. Light weight
6. Good resolution as it is Full HD.

Cons
1. Monitor cannot be adjusted up or down as other monitors.
2. There is only one button at the back which is a 5 way joystick for ON/OFF and also to navigate through all the menus. (Usually joysticks are not so durable so not sure about this as you don't have to use the button every time. Hoping for the best)",3,5
Duplicate remote and ve,"Replaced my 10 yr old HP v15 screen with this. My desktop got a whole new life. The screen is excellent. Great picture quality and the curve give a premium feel. My desktop user experience does not make me feel that I am using a 10 yr old system.
Well, i got a good spec machine. And this suits the need.",7,5
Worst Product. Please do not purchase.,"I needed an extended full HD monitor for editing and music composition purposes. And to avail the comfort of not tilting my head much, I opted for the Samsung monitor.

Initially I received a faulty product, which did not turn on at all.
I reported that to customer service and in literally 24 hours, ie the next day morning I had a replacement waiting at my door step.
Great service by Amazon.

The installation is super easy. The instruction manual is pretty self explanatory. And the replacement monitor worked like a charm..

I had used the monitor for a little over two months I guess and here are the pros and cons and my observations.

Suitable for editing ? : NO. Take a hard pass there.

Suitable for work from home? : Oh yeah baby!

Suitable for music production? : Definitely

Suitable for casual browsing and media consumption? - Sure !

How is the quality - The high definition videos Play great if you sit in front of the screen. The detail is there. Absolutely great for media consumption.

Colors ? - This is where the problem is. As I said, not for editors or photographers. I tried all combinations of screen adjustments. Big no. Absolutely perfect for general population. Not for film technicians.

Viewing angle? - average to be honest. I am the type of guy who sits in front of the PC, so it's cool for me. But if you view from left or right, you see the sceen is almost faded and whitish.

Surface? - The back of the monitor is fragile and perhaps made of bad plastic. Gotta handle with care or the board may get damaged. Weight of the device is less.

Good for gaming? - naah ! I'm not a gamer. Yet I can say it's not for gaming.

Finally, good for work from home, media consumption & reading.

Not for gaming, editing or photography editing.",One,5
One Star,"This is a decent curved monitor considering it’s price. Overall it’s a good display, but it have some downsides as well. My eyes are used to apple’s retina displays. Most of the time i use iPhone, iPad and i can feel the difference between retina and this display. I’m not comparing both displays, because there’s huge price difference in that. So i’ll list the downsides that i found with its display.

1- Smaller texts are not that great, even while being black on white. The text are not that smooth and i’m not satisfied with it.

2- I don’t know what this issue could be exactly called, but i’ll explain it. I can see very fine horizontal lines on display if we pay closer attention towards it, otherwise it won’t be visible and most likely you’ll not gonna notice it, unless you are doing a light video/photo editing.

3- once we turn on eye saver mode, we can’t adjust the brightness. I find it way brighter for my eyes at eye saving mode and the brightness will be at 50% approx when we turn on eye saver mode. As soon as we turn on eye saver mode, the colors just wash out, they look as if we are seeing through a very mild fog. I tried to adjust the contrast in eye saver mode but it didn’t help, so unfortunately i had to switch back to normal mode and adjust the brightness to approx 45% so that it don’t hurt my eyes. Let me be clear to those people who are going to buy this monitor for eye saver mode, better go for some other monitors as the colours just fade away in that mode and don’t look good to watch.

I’ll edit my review if i find any other problem or if i find the solution for that issue in eye saver mode.",Helpful,5
Ok at this price Band But,"I really like this monitor.. Just on second day with it... I looks great and bought this for 13K was good. Only set back personally I felt was HDMI input, there is only one, but I have two machines to connect. But, I already have an external HDMI switch with four inputs... so, issue sorted. It is a great buy.

Bleeding Problem:
I read about bleeding issue on this montior (watched few youtube videos and reviews on that as well). still went for buying due to price. And Yes, it bleeds, but not while you look straight from your sitting position, if you go side to sides looking for bleeding, yes, you can find them clearly. So, not an issue.

Others:
It don't have any speakers... you need to use audio out jack to connect to an external speaker. It has a VGA input, not so useful for me and you get one VGA cable from the box as well (may be useful for connecting old laptops). Stand is good, but fixed, my table is already a bit above average height, this stand takes the monitor little above my viewing position now, can't find a way of adjusting the height with the stand.",7,5
Worst and horrible service from Philips.,"Ok it came early so it was good....packing was nice...easy to install
Pros :- Amazing picture quality, curved screen really eases the eye to look at screen, doesn't heat up even after long use (Full Day) , slim fits perfectly at you small desk too

Cons :- alright only one con side is the stand doesn't seem to be strong it feels like it will break easily it wobbles even a slight movement of the table.

Just that over all good stuff in 10k no regrets so far...would update if fond some thing new.",Helpful,4
Total damage product,"The box contains only vga cable and no hdmi cable so i think they should have provided it in the box since it is no where near cheap. Using with vga initially i was seeing wavy lines but when i connected my laptop to the powerline then it was gone, might be possible that it is due to electric issues only with me. The picture quality when using hdmi is perfect no issues whatsoever, the audio is also transfered in sync and the aux port can be used with either headphones or home theater(also cable not included).

People are complaining about the screen bleeding issue but i have not encounterd it with my unit and even when watching movies it provides a good experience, keep in mind that you will have black bars at the top and bottom because of the aspect ratio as this is not an ultrawide monitor.

Another con might be that the monitor has no adjustments for viewing angle or height so you will have to either keep it on a stand or some old books if you want to make it at your eye level. The curvature is there but doesn't feel like you have any benefit of the curvature unless you have two monitors. I bought this just for the heck of it being curved and satisfy my desire to use it before the tech dying away and i am not at all disappointed. If you are getting this around 8k then it is a worth purchase, i bought it when it was priced at around 9.5k which seems more than what it is offering",Helpful,4
Worst Products...Waste of Money,"Purchased 27inch model. Very nice monitor. Cinema mode is good but for normal desktop work you will have to customize brightness sharpness and contrast between 50 and 80 as per your taste in custom mode. This will avoid too much of everything and black levels will look good. Game mode is making edges more sharper which i didnt like. Under custom settings as suggested white light bleed in edges will also reduce. Angle views are also good. For photo editing and exact color repriduction go for an ips panel. But ips panel might get burnt images in panel if u leave system in same page for long time. Unfortunately i cldnt use freesync since i have nvidia. Sticking to 60hz. In freesync it goes till 90hz as i heard so.

While watching movies in some modes i noticed image jittering then and there. In custom mode didnt notice that after some time. Eye saving mode is good but it adds more brightness with yellowtint. So we can use custom settings in monitor and windows 10 night mode which worked well. Disable samsungs eye saving mode.

To consolidate its a very good monitor for gaming, work and watching movies.",3,1
"Stylish Design, Fantastic Build & Quality - Value for Money! Highly Recommended","Many people seem to complain about bleeding and other things, when clearly it is not designed for that sort of functionality. It's simple physics, because of it's curvature, no matter how you look at it, the bezels WILL show this ""bleeding"" as they are emitting light for the display; and if you're going to buy this monitor for only pointing out this ""bleeding"" effect (unless its a defect) then I suggest you return this product and look elsewhere as this is the best price-to-performance gaming monitor out there.

Now for the review; this monitor is among the best 1080p monitors out there, especially for a 27"" display. The packaging is fairly simple and straightforward, with easy access to all the parts; however, please take care to remove the monitor last AFTER you have affixed the in-built stand, as it will be easier for handling and setting it up.

The joystick is precise and quite audible for a haptic interface, confirming each selection of the menu with a nice audible click. However, the menu options are a bit lacking, for example, when connected to my computer, I cannot adjust the brightness of the screen, nor do I get the option in the control panel; this is one of the reasons I reduced a star from the Overall rating (in case anyone else has a solution, please feel free to correct me). Apart from that, the EyeCare+ technology is good, increasing brightness while reducing the Blue spectrum to protect your eyes even at night but still provide a good gaming experience.

The assembly of the monitor is fairly easy, where you screw the base to the ""stem"" of the monitor stand, and can be done by hand; an excellent thinking on Samsung's part to provide a revolving handle on the screw for this purpose, you would've needed a Philips No 2 screw driver for the assembly otherwise.

Another negative feedback to Samsung however, is to include DVI cables instead of HDMI cables; almost all modern GPU's and motherboards now come with HDMI ports or Display Ports cables, while DVI cables are becoming redundant. Please start including the same, especially of you advertise it as a gaming monitor; such monitors will almost always be paired with a PC system dedicated for gaming, meaning it will have a discrete graphics card, and hence HDMI or Display ports.

Lastly, the display itself; the monitor has a very high refresh rate and when paired with an AMD graphics card, will give extremely smooth displays on the AMD FreeSync technology. Physically though, in case the viewing angle doesn't feel right, you can tilt monitor vertically, by pushing either the top of the display bezel or pulling it; please take care NOT to press the panel as it can damage the display, neither I, nor Samsung, will take responsibility if the tilting of the monitor is done incorrectly and ends up damaging the panel (this feature, rather strangely, is NOT given in the manual).

Finally, let the graphics software analyse the monitor and define the recommended display settings for the monitor, which usually sits at 1920x1080. In case you have discrete graphics, I would recommend leaving the recommended settings as it is.",Helpful,1
Perfect Home theatre for house Parties,The only thing i dont like about this monitor is the build quality of stand. When u pay around 15k bucks u expect very good build quality. I'm quite disappointed with samsung. Apart Stand quality rest part/performance is very great. Second things because of curvy nature of this monitor if u r only user or i can say at a time one person than its pleased to see whatever one the monitor.,4,5
Nice product,"My Experience: So I got this product a year before . It was defective from the get go . Multiple cracks and half the screen wasn't working. Got a replacement few days later .
Quality: I got this product to play games. The quality is way below par as compared to modern monitors. Graphic intensive games like God of war and rdr2 don't look that good . Their isn't even a speaker in it. I primarily played rainbow six . I couldn't properly see people while ingaging in long range gunfights. Mainly due to poor rendering and small size of the monitor.
Late Experience: I got used to it and quite frankly it was okey when I adjusted my gameplay according to it. But as of August 2020 it has stopped working . I mean it was a decent monitor for 8k rupees but still I would have loved to used it for few more months .",5,5
Why no display?,I recently purchased from Amazon and found it very nice.. A beautiful shiny case and stand looks preety on office desk. and curved screen gives more relief to eys as compared to the previous one flat monitor. Also the picture quality is very very good gives feel of theater in a dark. picture brightess is perfact and its really worty buying and total value for money. The reason i gave it 4 star because it does not has inbuilt speakers if this feature would have been added this will become the perfact package for movies and gamin. but overall its worth buying.. Thanks to Samsung and Amazon for providing this product with good price.,Helpful,5
"Best home theatre , thumping deep bass 😍 ,clear vocals, loud sound 🤩 and a cute remote . ..","This monitor isn't really for everyone. It's a good monitor, I really liked some aspects of it, but the cons of this monitor overwhelm the pros of the monitor, not by much though. If you can live through the cons, this monitor just might be for you. Gonna start with the cons:
1. Backlight Bleeding - If you don't know what this means, the LCD(liquid crystal display), the screen, is Backlit by CCFL/LED's, the LCD blocks out the backlight that is not needed when displaying a particular image. When this light is not 100% blocked, allowing excess light to ""bleed"" around the edges of the LCD panel.
This issue makes the background light up at some spots at the edges on a dark/black background. This is really annoying. It did bother me. This type of issue happens when the monitors are not 'factory calibrated'.
2. Viewing Angles - Monitor is advertised for 178degrees, which is not entirely true. You can see as wide as 178degrees. But colours especially blacks and whites turn into greyish black and yellowish white, image(desktop wallpaper) quality really gets worse after about 40 degrees from centre, also the light spots due to backlight bleed really starts to show up at when you watch screen from the angle, However shockingly when watching movies, the viewing angles are much better, still can't be compared with an IPS panel viewing angles, which are way better than these. (This monitor has a VA panel)

Now for the pros, and why should you get it?
1. Deep Blacks - Oh my god, I loved the blacks of this screen, but only when viewing from the centre. This monitor has deep rich blacks than any IPS panel screen I have worked on. Blacks tend to get screwed up when viewing from the angle due to backlight bleed.
2. Curved screen - At this price point, this is the only curved screen in the market. Curved screen doesn't really matter for 24"" 16:9 monitor. It's not wide enough to really feel that immersive experience. Although aesthetically it does look pleasing, your family members or friends will get intrigued by seeing a curved screen. As a user, it didn't really matter to me. This one is subjective user to user.

My verdict, if you can live through backlight bleeding and weird colour reproducing when viewing through angles. This monitor produces really deep contrast images with vivid colours when viewing from the centre and it just might for you.

Professionals - I won't recommend for professionals or for office use. However, It will work for professional use if you work alone and doesn't really care about viewing angles. Still better if you go with an IPS panel monitor.

Hardcore gamers - I won't recommend for hardcore gaming too, No gaming monitor is made of VA panel. Do you wanna win a game or have a better contrast?

Casuals - Recommended for this category, this category is for people who wanna use for browsing, do some gaming but are not a hardcore gamer. Someone who watches a lot of movies. This might be the right one for you and a steal deal for the price you are getting compared to the rest of the market.

I returned the monitor because of the annoying backlight bleed issue.",One,5
Great home theatre in this price,"Updated review : new 2019 stock all have yellow white point.. If you watch a white photo.. It s looking yellow.. When I contacted samsung they say it is fine...yellow is white for them... Don't even think of buying this monitor... They are cheating Indian customer by selling defective items... 2019 stock all have yellow tinge.. Cannot be fixed.. Even my replacement had it.. So had to return it again.... I never expected samsung brand to cheat Indian customer like this.. Shame on you samsung..

Old review :If you siiting exactly in middle then it s fine.. If you are seeing from side then it sucks.. Edges are darker than middle.. Picture quality s good..viewing angle sucks.. Power button is in back side and not easy to use.. Max frame rate 60 hz.. 3 years warranty",3,5
Superb,"Okay let's start off the things you shouldn't get it to do in it: Video rendering, Photo editing, Graphic designing, Programming or any kind of editing related to texts and visuals.
The things this is good for: Gaming and watching movies and for your entertainment purposes.

Just look at the first image (*sharpness is on 60). The text looks pixelated (your eyes will catch more than my camera did) and it becomes hard to read the small texts. Obviously a 15'' 1080p display would look good but when you pack those pixels in a larger 24'' display, you're gonna get more jagged edges. The pictures look fine but if you're looking at the tiny ones (e.g. a youtube thumbnails), you'll notice how grainy they are.

It's hasn't even been 2 month and yet I got a dead (or stuck) pixel and the HDMI port stopped working. Now, I'm stuck with the VGA. I will claim the warranty and get it checked off! Edit: HDMI port wasn't faulty, the cable was. Also, using a premium quality cable drastically improves the picture quality and sharpness!

It does have tilt! People who are saying this can't be tilted, must look at the fourth picture. Just apply some force to the upwards and it will tilt!

Some users are complaining about the bleeding issue (from the sides) and the bad viewing angles. But they must know before buying this is that it is a VA panel (clearly mentioned in title, isn't it?) and VA panels are all about the center & single-person things. So if you're buying one, then you must know that you are buying it for yourself and not for the person looking at your monitor from the side. But these panels tend to have good color productions (not as IPS though) but it doesn't seem to be with this monitor. With some tweaks I somehow managed some fixes for the yellowish tint and washed out colors:
(I have my brightness on 30)
- Set the sharpness to 60/63 and the contrast to 75. (If isn't already)
- Go to the Color and set the gamma to Mode3, Red to 43, Green to 45 and the Blue to 52. This will produce more vibrant colors and fix the yellowish tint.
- *Keep the Samsung Upscale turned off, it certainly drops the image quality and increases sharpness.
- Choose the response time as fastest (optional).
And adjust the tilt and make it more centered, so the bad viewing angles won't bother you.
If you're planning to buy it just to game and watch movies, you can go for it. 27'' model would be better, because you will less notice the curve from the middle in the smaller one. A 24 inch monitor with curve is straight up a gimmick!
But if it's not for your entertainment purposes, then I'd recommend you to go with the LG's 22'' IPS monitor (priced same as this one on Amazon). The larger screen and curve must not allure you, a large monitor will only look sharp and good if it's at least 1440p and having an IPS panel.",Helpful,5
Superb bass but sound is slow,"Hi, overall this is a good budget monitor, mostly for those who are working from home and need a bigger workspace to work. But there is an issue that is not mentioned anywhere in the review/description. It is 27-inch screen but 1920 x 1080 (which it's only HD monitor) that is very less. For a screen like 27-inch it should be at least 2K supporting screen to show image with good resolution. Here is is showing image pixelated. You can easily distinguish the pixel dot's. Instead of buying this 27-inch i would suggest to go with it's 23-inch monitor. Else you can go for other product which supports 2K or 4K resolution that is required for video and Gaming.

Wrost product,Noting unique just like any other monitor. I would give it five stars if it runs for more than 8 yrs as I hardly use it.i have monitors running flawlessly for more than 10yrs. I am just very annoyed with the user interface is not really exciting You need to do it manually ie no presets. Also I am not sure why some outlines around images and articles in the web browser appear to be either too light or just too fade to notice. However pictures and videos seem to be fine. I am very unhappy for the monitor keeps going off and on if someone runs a motor or a sewing machine and also when I turn off the pc monitor is still on for about 10 mins and then it will go off. Honestly I am at the brink of being a detractor only the life of this monitor will change my opinion. But no real issue its ok,Helpful,5

Dislike - Monitor mounting not hinged - cannot adjust.
Single button joystick power button controller is not user friendly.
Plug point design too wide, does not easily fit on multi point with other plugs in place.
No DVI cable input. HDMI Cable not in the box.
Given all of the above, I still decided to keep it just because it is a curved monitor at the price for home use use.",Helpful,5
Very good model,"I had used this product for close to 16 months. The clarity, color, brightness all fit what you are looking for in a gaming monitor. I had occasionally used it for work as an extra monitor. The only issue with this is that the screen and LED panel are extremely flimsy.

While trying to adjust the the screen position, I held the bottom left corner of the screen with my thumb and index finger. This cracked the LED screen and now the monitor is useless. Replacement of the LED will cost me 4K INR which is almost as expensive as the monitor.

If you are planning to buy this, be extremely careful while handling this.",Helpful,5
"Awesome! Nice monitor 1ms RT, 2watt Stereo Speakers, 102% RGB, Blue-ray block, VESA mounting.","Pros-
Only one and that is- You can watch movies and play games on big screen. Still viewing angle is issue.

Cons (First view - 1 Star)-
Here is a big list-
1) It's panic for eyes when reading anything. Text edges looks pixelated.
2) Not showing HD. It has HD aspect ratio but not has better contrast to display an image in high resolution.
3) No true colors. Views are not high defications.
4) I am a developer so typing codes 6-8 hours per day. I can't survive with this monitor. I am getting headache in half or an hour of use. Because texts looks pixelated and blur.
5) No HDMI cable provided.
6) Not a sharp display.

After 2 days of use (1 Star) -
7) Light tearing. Not from sides only it's tearing from front too. I can see light tearing from corners and bottom edges on a black screen. That's why it's panic for eyes.

After 7 days of use (3 Star)-
For reading I have set Sharpness to 60 and looks some okay okay. Working better with HDMI cable. You have to adjust screen settings according to your need.

10 days of experiments-
Scale windows to 125% for better reading experience.

Best in this price,"Have mostly used UW multitasking screens so maybe my expectations are skewed, but you decide.

As a secondary workspace required a budget screen. This one checks all the marks for the price... except that it has 0 adjustability for screen angle... it doesn’t go an inch in any direction... and it being curved screen it requires to be perfectly aligned to eyes failing which it creates a very distorted view and text appears curved as well.

Productbaclit display was defected,The picture quality is nice but there is a constant buzzing sound which keeps changing depending upon what’s displayed on the screen.

All 3 monitors have different brightness levels with one monitor being very bright. This makes it very difficult to use in a dual or a triple monitor setup because each monitor shows colors differently. I have done factory reset on all of the 3 monitors prior to use and they all have different colors out of the box. I have spend hours trying to adjust the RGB values individually and I cannot get all the 3 monitors to match the colors. Additionally there is a severe problem with clouding which can be clearly noticed.

I contacted customer care and they asked me to send pictures of the screen. When i sent them, they replied back saying there is a physical damage because of which the screen is damaged and it won't be covered under warranty. But there are no marks on the screen to indicate that there was a physical damage.
When i asked the customer care about it, they say if someone had unintentionally pressed the screen a little harder also it would break like this. I had nothing to say to the guy on phone when he said this.

So the monitor is cheap. But the screen is very fragile. And if the screen breaks on its own also, it will not be covered under warranty. But the Samsung Customer Care guys were very responsive and supportive. But because it was not covered under warranty, they couldn't help.",One,4
Best budget wqhd monitor,"1. Purchased this product on 9th Aug
2. Delivered on 11th Aug
3. During my work on 8th sep i have seen issues with screen display
4. Contact Amazon service center and get a suggestion to call Samsung to fix this
5. A Samsung representative called me and asked me to share a pic of screen
6. Based on screen pic they diagnostic that it is physical damage and do not cover under warranty
7. I asked clarification ""Why is it external damage as it does not have an external mark from outside""
8. They answered - They have this technology without external mark - internal damage can happen and will not cover warranty .
9. I contact back to Amazon service representative and they asked letter from Samsung
10. I asked for a letter from Samsung - they sent me a repair cost which is almost the same as product cost
11. And now in stuck in between Amazon and Samsung :-)",4,4
Value for money product.,Picture quality is good but when HDMI connected to laptop I feel slight electric passed through my hands whenever I press on my MacBook Air. This is not happening with other monitors in my office. The reason maybe the power cord is only two pin without ground.,2,4
The best 32 inch QHD monitor under 20k ₹,"I have bought this product seeing additional warranty of 2 years as festive offer, but unfortunately the serial number is showing as invalid in the Samsung website while registering the product for additional 2 years warranty",2,4
Value for Money with good picture quality,"I bought this for my father. Within one month, the display cracked from the middle without any physical damage. Samsung sent a technician, who did not do any work. He sent photos of the monitor and went back saying ""physical damage, no warranty"". There was absolutely no physical damage at all. It was working fine for one whole month before suddenly becoming defective. As customer support abandoned us, filed a consumer case. Waiting for resolution. Will never buy another Samsung product again. Meanwhile, bought an Acer monitor without curve. It's been 6 months, and the monitor is superb.",2,4
So far so good..no issues seen,I do not know about others but it seems that I received a defective product or that the product is just bad. It's nothing to do with the curvature rather the screen and pixel rendering. Any images rendered on this monitor have jagged edges (aliasing) and blur which makes it very hard for your eyes to focus on anything especially text. It seems the pixels around the edges only half fire. If you have elderly persons in your household who use this it is going to damage their vision.,2,4
Good Monitor with Irritating Controls.,"Looks great, sleek design. Curve is great, just the right amount. Nothing this big(32 inches) for this price.

Good but there is an issue,"Got it for 14999. What else can i ask for a 32 inch curved monitor which is almost bezel less and having a beautiful stand. Using it for around 3 weeks. There are various pre adjusted colour modes to suit your eyes in any condition. Have all necessary ports in the monitor, i.e. vga port, dvi port, hdmi port, audio port. As it is a 60-75hz monitor, it is not meant for high end real time gaming.
I will update my review later if anything bad happens to the monitor, for now it is working flawlessly and a pleasure to the eyes.",One,3
Best monitor the casual users,Was looking to buy a TV when I came across this acer monitor and I changed my mind. 16000/- for a 32 inch curved monitor seemed a very good deal as no other monitor could match the price for this size. I don’t know how good or bad is this for gaming as I am not into gaming nor how good the colour scheme is when compared to others or if it’s good for programming. My sole purpose was to watch movies and videos and that is serves amazingly well. The picture quality is fantastic and the curvature of the screen gives a very good feel while watching movies. Never heard it’s sound as I connect my cpu to 2 tower speakers bought separately again from Amazon. Watching movies is now a very awesome experience. Delivery was very prompt thanks to amazon and the product looks very elegant and sturdy. Its sleek design adds to the aesthetics of my room and I am absolutely pleased by its performance. A product worth every penny spent on it!!,Helpful,3
"MATTE FINISH, GREAT DISPLAY GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY,"," Pros:
*Full HD monitor at this price is the best deal.
*Large monitor is a treat to watch videos.
*I use this monitor for my daily work. Easy to read emails and action it. (ensure you got minimum 1.5 feet distance from monitor) to avoid seeing pixels in the words.
*1080p supported monitor and I have 4k LG TV. When I play the same video, I can see colors are bright and good in the monitor which is full HD compare to the LG TV which is 4k.
*Games like American truck simulator and GTA V is good and especially while playing truck game it looks like we drive in real road due to the size of the monitor.
Not sure about latest games.
Trust me people, at night time, lights turned off and you watch a HD video with good external speakers and you have the best movie experience with this monitor.
Thought I watch all marvel movies at past. Again I watched in this monitor during dark and lights turned off and it was a different experience.
Cons:
While using for work related emails and excel, you can notice pixels when you are too close to the monitor.
Video anything below 1080p quality won't be nice. you see lot of pixels",2,3
Trusted Monitor,Very nice curved monitor and I bought two. When compared to Samsung curved 27 inch it's price is less than 4000 to 5000 bucks. I think its stand looks better than Samsung stand. Initially I was going to buy Samsung but coincidentally reached acer and it was a good decision.,One,3
"No VGA || DVI, HDMI port present",I saw multiple comments complaining about backlight bleeding. Indeed its correct but don’t expect a 15k monitor that too a curved one with 32 inch size to have all the feature n quality of 60-70k monitor. I purchased it for office work and its serving its purpose perfectly fine. The only shortcoming which could have been avoided by the manufacturer was to give provision for wall mount. Though you can still make it wall mount through aftermarket VESA bracket however you will have to shell out another 4-5k which do not make much sense.,Helpful,3
Good for production work,"It is a piece of art. Exceptional build quality, curvey white and silver beauty.
Got it for work/programming, and seems to be perfect. Initially had some issue adjusting to the monster of a screen(my previous moniter was just 20inch) and slight pixilation that comes with big non 4k screens.
The default setting is soft and comfortable to the eyes. Perfect for my purpose.
Got it with all sort of connectivity cables like HDMI, VGA, 3.5mm(audio only, no mic). The moniter also has two 3.5 mm ports for audio and mic in case you want to plugin a headphone when using HDMI.
Highly recommended for programing and regular office work.
Note- The inbuild speakers are probably useless, very low volume.",2,3
Good enough for creative individual.,"This monitor with curve screen look beautiful, colours are good for gaming watching Full HD video, I have 2 gb graphics card so picture look more clear and accurate. Best curve monitor at this price range.",3,3

Good but read the reviews carefully before you buy,"After using it for nearly a month I can say that this is one of the best curved monitors available at this price, it comes with a warranty of 3 years, looks r amazing and picture quality is good, something of this size and looks at this price has really amazed me. That said, didn’t give it full 5 star because it has slight back light bleeding issue, believe me u won’t notice it while u r watching anything, it is noticeable when the screen is pitch black. Also, the speakers r just alright. Since I needed this monitor to connect my laptop and do my office work, I find it really great",Helpful,3
Decent display but serious backlight bleeding issue,"I got this for 14.2K (inclusive of bank discount) and would say this is a steal deal !
75Hz (atleast as read by my pc) , curved, FHD and 32"" at this price is fabulous.

Also in box you get
-power cord (and adaptor)
-hdmi cable
-vga cable
-DVI cable

As read here, people see dead pixels,i'll be monitoring this issue and update the review if I face any.
Conclusively, am pretty happy with this purchase.

Cons : The screen bleeding issue is true...you would see bleeding on a blank screen",146,2
Monitor is good but received a faulty piece,"This is a very decent monitor within this price range, got on offer for 14299
This monitor is basically for daily use and not high end video editing. The screen is big and you have to adjust the mode (if you go very close to the screen you can see the text is breaking since it is 1080p only and has 32 inch screen) to sit near to it to work especially if you are coding or writing a ms word file. The video quality is also good for watching movies. This also has speakers which has very minimalist sound ( ok if fan is off ). I recommend this monitor to those who wants a big screen to just do daily activities",Helpful,2
Good Product,"The monitor works like a charm, the screen is huge and it has good picture and audio quality. Sure the speakers aren't big enough for a large room but that can be fixed with external speakers. HDMI, DVI, VGA, and everything else as written in the product details.

The resolution isn't high enough, if you notice closely, the picture will be pixellated. I would suggest you go with a 4K resolution if you're going for this size, but unfortunately none of them are this cheap.

The curve is good, build quality is nice, just go for it :)",Helpful,2
"Justifying it's price , disappointed with black level of this monitor.","Product is very good.
I was afraid about the curved monitor esp about working from sides as I had always used flat monitor, but the curvature does not cause any such issue. It takes time to get used to the curved screen.
Colours are more in flatter tone. That's one of the negative. You don't feel the same colour quality as in laptop monitor.",614,1
Decent average monitor,"Best product if you getting near 15k,as per me there is only brightness adjustment showing error it going high so difficult long time watch in dim light or dark room, on and off botton personally i dont like because if you move its in closing time its go to program and features. There than this you can definitely go for it.",281,1
Returning it back,The screen has slight bleeding issues but it doesn't really affect picture quality. Don't rely on the speakers. They are pretty useless. Good for gaming and watching. Found it slightly big initially for work but later adjusted to it and it was okay for that as well.,72,1
Dead Pixels,"This is a really good monitor for work. I would happily give 5 stars to this monitor but here are two reasons :

1) Sounds quality is not good as i expected
2) I received monitor on 29th August and Bought it for ₹17,499 but at the same day I checked price and it was ₹14,499.

Good Display But Acer's QA is not good.,"The Product Spec says its 75Hz refresh rate, but it actually 60Hz only. Its the wrong info. conveyed to Customers from ACER itself. I checked in official ACER site itself, where it says this ACER ED273 Monitor is 75Hz but actually when we see the settings of the Monitor, it says clearly as 60Hz only. For 60Hz monitor, spending 15K is little costlier only. My advice is that if anyone is ok with 60Hz then go for it.

Eventhough its 60Hz, I dont see any issue/lag though am using it for my Office work purpose. Haven't tried with Gaming. Overall, Product is good but only disappointing point is that its 60Hz ONLY but where it says 75Hz.",4,1

Honest review after 2 Months,"Hi Team,

I have recently bought an Acer31.5 inch monitor (ED322Q). I am facing a lot of backlight bleeding issues. While watching a movie or when the screen is black, I could see a lot of background light noise. I have attached a picture also for your reference.

I would like to request you to please raise a replacement request as my entire work is dependent on this monitor currently. On amazon there is no replacement policy, all I could see is a return option. However, I would not like to return this product at the moment. It would be nice if you can replace the monitor with a new one and do proper quality control before sending a replacement.",Helpful,4

Average product,"I bought the 24MP400 when it was just launched. There used to be no reviews back then, and I was afraid of screen bleeding issue as reported by many other users across the internet for IPS screens in general

But nevertheless, it was my only option and I bought it. I upgraded from a TN panel that I bought in 2007.

I must tell you, that you can safely ignore screen bleeding problems that are reported by many people across the internet for almost all the IPS screens BECAUSE the degree of screen bleeding that you see in their photos depends on from what angle they capture the photo.

I have been using the monitor for many months now, and all is good.

When it arrived, I, due to my apprehension of screen bleeding issue, tried to see if my screen also has problem and captured photos. And I found that as I changed the position of camera, the bleeding changed too. From some angles and distances, it was very pronounced, and from some, it was nil.

So, ultimately, its of no use to disregard a product due to petty screen bleeding reviews that are everywhere on internet. Yes, some monitors may be really bad, and therefore due caution be taken. But in most cases, all will be good.

Eyes don't detect the screen bleeding the way camera detects.",One,3

I would have wished for the inbuilt speakers to be a bit louder, but that’s fine i use a Bose Sound system.
Also, if you sit in front of your screen for extended periods of time..i would also suggest to add the Benq Screenbar Plus..enjoy and thank me later 🙂

* Comes with usb hub (4 usb 3.0 ports), but if you use macbook you need another usb c to usb a connector. LG 27UL850 comes with 2 usb 3.0 ports, but it uses the same usb c cable used for display/charge.

* Screen quality is very good, a bit better than LG 27UL850.

* Stand is very sturdy unlike the flimsy stand used by LG 27UL850.

They denied replacement even after they unable to repair it.",3,5
Fantastic...its heaven on earth for gamers...go for it blindly,"I received this monitor on 10-Jun-2021. This is a one-day old review. I was looking long for 28""~32"" size monitor for my Photography editing as well as personal work. I finally zero'ed on BenQ. Here are my first impressions:

Pros:
- Brilliant colours. I am a Ps user and I am aware of colour gamut and correctness. While maybe the SW series may be better, I don't think that with 100% sRGB, this lags behind. I am not a professional photographer, so this monitor is excellent for me. Professionals and ""picky"" people may go for the SW series. The BenQ SW2700PT with 99% Adobe RGB could be better but note that is QHD (1440p) and not UHD (2160p).
- I now know that 32"" would have been too big. Even with this 27"", at 1.5' away I have to rotate my head to get full view.
- 3840x2160 pixels with exceptional clarity. I observed no backlight bleeding and BenQ Display Pilot software helps me to tune the monitor to my need and the way I work. For example, during normal use, I turn on the ""Reading"" mode that helps in toning down the brightness, etc.

Cons: No matter how good, there are always some 'cons':
- Expensive
- Thick bezel and tad heavy and this affects the next point
- The USB and other controls are somewhat inaccessible. It would have been nice if some USB ports were available on the sides. The manufacturer assumes that one will fix all USB cables and there will be no need to add new. To connect new connections (be it USB, HDMI, speakers/headphones, etc.) one has to lay the monitor flat. The monitor is heavy and I have to use a soft pillow to lay it flat. Then I can reach the rear connections. (see pics 2 and 3). This is the greatest drawback.

For these 3 points, I have docked off one star.

Another small issue. The monitor is shipped with a mains cable having a 15A plug. Cannot understand the reason why for the life of it. the power consumption is just 80W. I had to go and buy a compatible mains cable with a 5A plug and the original is useless for me.",18,4
As promised,"The product delivered was packed excellent and product initial impressions were also good. The HDMI cable connectivity needs to selected in the monitor if not, it will be showing black screen and no cable connected. Please take care of it. Otherwise the product is good, volume is too low, and doesn't change even of you increase.",10,4
Value for money,"Its a pretty good monitor and you will find better, detailed reviews online for this monitor. However, one thing to keep in mind when ordering this monitor - you have to order a separate power cable. What BenQ provides in the box is too big for most Indian power sockets.

JODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD MONITOR,"Eigentlich wollte ich mir einfach mal einen neuen Monitor gönnen - aber ich ahnte nicht wie schwierig das werden würde...
Meine Anforderungen waren:
27 Zoll und höhenverstellbar (ein höherer Bildschirm ist wegen meiner Gleitsichtbrille problematisch)
UHD Auflösung
IPS-Panel, mit guter Farbtreue (sRGB) um ab und zu ein Fotobuch zu machen
Integrierte Lautsprecher
Preis: bis 600€
optional: USB-Hub

Mit diesen Anforderungen fand ich folgende Modelle, die ich (bis auf den letzten von AOC) nach und nach bestellte und zurückschickte:
Viewsonic VG2748
BenQ BL2711U
LG 27UK850-W
BenQ PD2700U
AOC U2777PQU

Vorbemerkung: alle diese Monitore erfüllen meine Anforderungen an die Auflösung und die Bildqualität.
Das Bild war(subjektiv) durchweg sehr gut, aber...

Viewsonic VG2748: Der Monitor war gut, aber der Klang der Lautsprecher war wirklich übel.
Das macht jede Bluetooth-Box für 10 Euro besser. Das Gerät war allerdings auch deutlich günstiger als die anderen Geräte.
Trotzdem - der Monitor ging zurück.

BenQ BL2711U: Der Bildschirm hatte immer wieder Aussetzer und zeigte kurz ein schwarzes Bild.
Klar, das könnte auch an dem Displayport-Kabel liegen - deshalb habe ich mehrere Kabel ausprobiert.
Seltsam, dass es das Problem bei dem vorherigen Gerät (Viewsonic) nicht gab.
Die Aussetzer blieben. Der Monitor ging zurück.

LG 27UK850-W: Endlich einmal ordentlicher Sound, und auch ein tolles Bild ohne Aussetzer. Aber das Design ist sehr speziell.
Eine weiße Rückseite! Und die Kabel werden hinten an der Seite angebracht, so dass die stylische Rückseite voller Kabel hängt?
In meinem Büro sieht man die Rückseite leider. Und außerdem lässt sich die Höhe nicht wirklich weit runter stellen.
Der Abstand zum Schreibtisch sind mindestens 8cm. Schon recht gut, aber für den Preisimmer noch nicht überzeugend. Der Monitor ging zurück.

BenQ PD2700U: Ein neuer Versuch mit BenQ - aber die Aussetzer sind wieder da. BenQ und mein Rechner wollen wohl nicht miteinander.
Der Monitor ging zurück. BenQ kommt nicht mehr in Frage.

AOC U2777PQU: Guter Sound, super Bild, keine Aussetzer! Das ist er endlich, mein Monitor!!!
Lediglich der spiegelnde Metallfuß müsste nicht sein. Aber angesichts der Vorgeschichte bin ich froh, endlich eine Lösung zu haben.

Great product,"Nice monitor, poor cable access, terrible setup instructions",2,3
"Bang for your buck,with some cons.","I'm using the monitor for photo editing and general word processing, spreadsheets and Powerpoint development. Once installed it's lovely to use, but the unpacking and setup process is pretty horrible.

Good points:

a) Lovely quality image.

b) Very comfortable to use and very adjustable, height, tilt, landscape or portrait orientation and so on.

Bad points:

c) Horrible ""getting started"" guide, the usual attempt to economise on translation and paper costs by providing ambiguous pictures with no words.

d) No paper manual, you have to read the manual on the disk - which is of course impossible until you've set up the monitor - which needs the manual.

e) Windows setup and driver installations don't work. E.g. settings they describe don't exist on my PC, and the ""update driver"" button is greyed out. I downloaded a driver from the BENQ web site but that didn't have any instructions on how to install it either. So I have no idea whether I have the correct driver or not which is frustrating.

f) Built-in speakers are pretty poor quality, worse than the ACER monitor which preceded this one.

g) Awful access for plugging in cables. They are underneath the monitor and pointing down, Impossible to get at when the monitor is in its normal operating position.

h) The BENQ control app called ""DisplayPilot"" is pretty confusing, and I had to remove it from my startup sequence because it froze in the middle of the screen and I had to kill it with task manager. Also, unhelpful in providing information, it tells you which driver is installed but not whether it's the correct / best driver.

Bottom line: Nice monitor if you survive the setup process.",One,3

one stuck pixel,"Update: Subsequently reordered this monitor and once again plug and play didn’t work. Packed up again and was about to return when I thought I’d try customer service again. This time they identified that the hdmi cable was only cable that worked and had to be manually selected on the monitor. Thereafter it worked great! On both 2012 and 2015 MacBooks. A simple fix that could have saved them and me a lot of hassle.

Original review: After a few hours of trying unsuccessfuly to get the BenQ PD2700U 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor to connect to either of my MacBook Pros (15"" 2012 & 2015), and after various restarts (NVRAM and SMC), I resorted to contacting the BenQ online support chat. They went through the usual basic steps of trying to resove the issue e.g. send us photos of where you plugged the cables in, etc. In the end they said, ""We will have to escalate this to technical support. Please send an email describing your issue and we'll get back to you in a few days."" Really? The screen did display briefly on two occasions but then disconnected again with a 'No connection detected!' message. OSD (On screen Display) was also only availabale briefly. All I can assume is that this is a faulty monitor straight out of the box or that it is incompatible with Macs. Tried to select the 'replacement' option offered by Amazon but this wasn't allowed so have had to send back for a refund.

Bad Brightness / bad picture clarity / over rated. / overall ratting 2.5/5,"Ok, so this is a difficult product to review. I've had it for about 6 weeks now having shopped around extensively for what I needed within my budget. From that point of view, this is an excellent purchase. I can't afford - nor do I need - a top of the range photo editing monitor costing £1k+ but I do need a monitor with good clarity and colour accuracy within a budget of approx £350-£500. From that point of view, this really is an excellent purchase and the added bonus of being 4k allows me to stream video and film in very high quality. All good so far.

However, as many reviews have stated there is a perceptible vignette at either side of the screen (slightly green / grey on the left. A lesser purple / grey on the right). I certainly wouldn't expect that level of vignette on a monitor which, although not premium, certainly is pricey and not entry level by any means.

So from that point of view, it's difficult to recommend to other users. Is it exactly what I need, with incredibly sharp picture and very good colour accuracy for under £500, with the bonus of very good quality 4k for streaming? Yes. Therefore it's exactly what I need within the price range I can afford.

If you're a pro-photographer, requiring absolute colour accuracy for product shoots my guess is you're looking to spend way more than this on a monitor anyway, so this won't be for you.

Does the vignette impinge on my photo editing or any other use I have of the monitor? No, not at all. It's minimal. However it is very frustrating that a product of this price by a pretty well established manufacturer is sent out with what is clearly a factory flaw.

I did toy with sending the monitor back and looking for a monitor from another manufacturer but decided that the quality of the colour and sharpness were worth the inconvenience of the sight vignette. I might live to regret that decision, but all things considered for the budget I have, to get a 4k monitor with the clarity and colour accuracy this model has I've decided to live with the slight flaws.",One,2

Beautiful color and screen reproduction quality.
- Easy on the eyes.

Cons:
- Average build quality - moderate light bleed but most importantly:

- Top left and top right corner exhibit a strange light effect. They are lighter, like light leaks somehow, but it's not the sort of light bleed you see on blacks - no light bleed on darks. But on light colors, it's there - red yellow cyan, etc. It's there for you to see.

HDR and Frequency,"This is an excellent monitor but with, for my eyes, one flaw. I won't extoll the monitor's virtues here - others will, I'm sure, do this.

But what is the flaw? The monitor has a semi-gloss screen, rather than a completely matte finished screen. Annoyingly, BenQ's website does not appear to have a straightforward specification page where this characteristic should be specified. The screen finish is similar to that on many TV screens. The problem is that this results in multiple reflections. For a TV such reflections will probably be completely unnoticed, but for a monitor they are bad news!

For my eyes this made the screen unacceptable and I sent back the monitor.

So, what is the moral of the story? Stick to a make where you are already fairly sure what you are getting. As for me, I shall probably return to Iiyama!",One,1

- HDR10
- VESA 100x100

2019/05/09 - Update:
Inzwischen hat BenQ einen umgetauscht. Alle drei nebeneinander ergibt dann ein ""einigermaßen"" gleiches weiß. Aber mit einer EIZO-Kalibrierung hat das noch nicht so viel zu tun. Ich werde ihn trotzdem behalten und habe jetzt 3 von denen. Danke hierfür an den BenQ-Kundendienst, der sich im Rahmen seiner Möglichkeiten vorbildlich verhalten hat. Ich habe deswegen von 1 auf 3 Sterne erhöht.

Re HDR unter Windows 10 v17763 und nVidia 430.39: geht immer noch nicht. Der erste mit Glück, und danach keine Chance, alle drei gleichzeitig im HDR-Modus zu haben. Mindestenms einer hat ausgewaschene blasse Farben und zeigt statt ""HDR"" ""User"" an. Kabel wie gesagt drei nagelneue Club 3D-Kabel.

2019/03/11 - Update:
Also, einer der beiden ist definitiv defekt. Ich habe ihn abgestöpselt. Der andere (rechts im Bild oben) hat nämlich die Bildfehler in schwarzen Bereichen nicht. Folgendes für den rechten, nicht-kaputten Monitor.
+++ Habe ein einem alten Monitor beigelegtes DP-Kabel mit 1.8m genommen und nur den rechten Monitor angeschlossen. HDR stabil mit 4k, 60Hz und RGB 10bpp.
--- Hatte auch kurz versucht, nativ RTX HDMI >> HDMI in den Bildschirm zu füttern. Jetzt gehen auf einmal vier Farbmodi (RGB, PCyCr4:4:4, PCyCr4:2:2, PCyCr4:2:0). Aber: HDR nur mit 8bit und Windows-Software-Dithering. Kein Zugewinn in der Bildqualität. Bei PCyCr4:2:2 und 420 gehen dann 10 und 12bit für HDR auch, ABER bei hohen Frequenzen (""schwarzer Text auf weißem Hintergrund"") sieht man schon bei 422 deutliche farbige Kanten am Rand der Buchstaben. --> NoGo.
Werde also den erst-gelieferten zurückschicken mit einem großen Bapperl dran: ""DEFEKT"".

Habe noch einen dritten bestellt, um die richtige Farbkalibrierung herauszufinden. Der rechte ist nie und nimmer auf 6500k kalibriert, gefühlt zu wenig blau drin.

2019/03/08 - Habe zwei aus dem Warehouse-Deal bekommen, mal schauen:
++ Sehr gut kalibriertes Bild, guter Weißwert
+ Mäßiger Schwarzwert, wenn man es drauf anlegt, sieht man natürlich das Backlight- und Edge-Bleeding
++ Umgebungslichtsensor: Wer ihn einmal hat, möchte ihn nicht mehr missen
++ Slim Bezel, sehr angenehm für Multimonitorbetrieb
++ Alle Einstellungen per ""Display Pilot"" Software änderbar
* Mechanische Tasten, etwas mühsam mit der Menünavigation so

Aber, es gibt drei Blocker, derzeit Verbindung RTX2080 DP1.4 >> BenQ DP1.2, GSYNC off:
--- Farbkalibrierung: mit identischen Einstellungen (sRGB und REC709 getestet) sind die Weißwerte unterschiedlich kalibriert bei beiden. Nervt tierisch.
--- In schwarzen Bereichen, z.B. dem offenen OSD oder wirklich schwarzen Filmszenen habe ich Pixelfehler, die immer an unterschiedlicher Stelle kurz aufblitzen. Sau nervig.
--- Ich hab's um's Verr3cken nicht geschafft, Monitore und Windows 10 zu einer stabilen HDR(10) Verbindung zu überreden. Ist Glückssache: Nach 7x ein- und ausschalten ist vielleicht einer der beiden dann im HDR-Modus, aber kaum starte ich dann eine andere Anwendung, z.B. BF5, wieder ausgewaschene Farben und blasses Bild ohne Ende. Und das obwohl Windows ""RGB 10bpp"" in den erweiterten Anzeigeeigenschaften bei beiden Monitoren angibt.

Werde jetzt noch versuchen, DP 1.4 >> HDMI 2.0a zuzuspielen, wenn das nicht klappt, gehen beide retour. Wenn es klappt, schau ich mal im Warehouse-Deal, ob es noch einen gibt, um dann zu schauen, welche Farbkalibrierung denn die richtige ist.",One,1

The product is bad.,"Kaufgrund für mich war die von Benq beworbene KVM-Switch-Funktion in Verbindung mit dem Preis, der Auflösung und der Größe des Monitors. Leider handelt es sich bei der Funktion nicht um einen KVM-Switch. Ich habe 2 Computer angeschlossen. Diese werden beide mit jeweils einem USB Kabel mit dem Monitor verbunden. Der eine Computer wurde dann per HDMI mit dem Monitor verbunden und der andere via Display-Port (es gibt leider nur eine HDMI Schnittstelle am Monitor). Am Monitor wurde eine Mouse und eine Tastatur an den USB Ports angeschlossen. Wenn man jetzt zwischen den beiden Computern hin und her schalten will, dann ruft man als erstes das Menü KVM im Monitor aus und wählt dort den entsprechenden Computer. Und jetzt kommt es. Nein, er schaltet NICHT auch das Videosignal um. Das muss man dann ZUSÄTZLICH durch Auswählen der Quelle (in meinem Fall HDMI bzw. Display-Port) auswählen. Das hat doch nun echt nichts mit einem KVM-Switch zu tun. Das sind 2 separate Arbeitsschritte. Völlig irreführend!!!

Den Monitor behalte ich trotzdem, das Bild ist für mich brauchbar.

Ansonsten: Den Sound der Monitorlautsprecher kann man vergessen. Auch den m.E. völlig überdimensionierten Monitorständer mit wesentlich zu großer Auflagefläche auf dem Tisch. Das Problem an der Sache ist, dass die Konstruktion einen es nicht ermöglicht, den Monitor nah an die Wand zu schieben. Es sind rund 17 cm Abstand von der Wand zum Display, näher kann man den Monitor also nicht ranschieben.

Würde ich ihn mir wiederkaufen? Wahrscheinlich nicht. Der Nicht-KVM-Switch nervt einfach.",Helpful,5

It's amazing for normal home office use.,"Plugged it in and loved the picture quality. I'm a serious amateur photographer and it's great to be able to enjoy my pictures on this big screen in this really excellent color. I've been staring at the screen for a good many hours and have no eye-strain to report. I haven't done any calibration on it yet but I don't think I will need to any time soon.

BUT the other reason I chose this model was its built-in KVM Switch. I have a big desktop computer that I use for most of the work of editing and cataloging my photos, plus I have a laptop that I take with me on trips. I also use the laptop to help manage the catalog and the storage of photos. That means that some of the time I'm switching between the two. My old monitor had a VGA connector and a DVI connector. I was able to connect the VGA connector to a simple KVM switch (ATEN CS22U) along with the keyboard USB and USB mouse, then switch from one to the other instantly at the touch of a button. The Keyboard, Video and Mouse would switch together, simultaneously and immediately from one computer to the other.

I expected the same function to be available as part of the BenQ monitor as it offers ""Keyboard video mouse (KVM) switch: Display contents from two PC systems using one set of keyboard and mouse to save space and boost work efficiency"". It was easy enough to connect up the two computers to the one monitor but it is not easy to switch between the two.

I struggled a bit with the manual to follow the instructions, probably because they were counter-intuitive. I was expecting a simple click and I found I had to perform a complex ritual of 15 clicks on buttons hidden underneath the front edge of the monitor. The first click on any button would bring up a visual menu aligned with the set of 6 buttons, so you could see which to press next. You would select different sub-menus and move the selection up and down these sub-menus according to where you were in the ritual. If you got it wrong you could be looking at the screen of one computer whilst moving the mouse of the other one. There's a time-out too - after a few seconds of wondering what to do next the on-screen control menu will disappear.

I went looking for help on the Internet and there was a BenQ YouTube tutorial about KVM. It was not very illuminating and mainly covered the connections (without visuals) and arcane (to me) configurations of PIP/PBP and multiple screens. There was a casual reference to custom keys and control keys in the user manual, so I went off to the manual - which I had already read but rather quickly, not knowing what I should be looking out for. But before I left the YouTube page I looked at the comments, or rather looked for comments as there were none. I left a comment about the lack of info about the exact USB connectors. Later I searched for that YouTube video tutorial and found it again but in a different place; this one had dozens of comments in several threads, all about the appalling KVM Switch functionality. So I've left some more there too.

I did find some stuff in the manual whereby I could define up to 3 custom keys from the 6 hidden buttons. Following the manual's recommendation I now have one button for the Input Source (video) and one each for the USB connection to the 2 computers. Now when I want to switch to the other computer I bring up the little menu, select the ""other"" USB source, then bring up the menu again and select Input, move the menu selection down or up to the ""other"" video source and click the OK button. That's still 6 clicks. Going back the other way it's also 6 clicks. That 6 times as many clicks as I needed with my 6 year-old ATEN KVM. Shocking.

I think this is a misrepresentation as the description says KVM Switch whereas it is really ""KM Switch and V Menu"". Not quite as snappy as is implied. The manufacturers suggest that I should set Auto Switch > ON which would mean that if I power off my computer at night the Monitor would switch to the other computer. That means that when I switch on in the morning I will be wondering why I can't do anything useful, until I remember that BenQ decided to switch to my laptop, hidden on its dock under the desk and probably also switched off. They really aren't very good at designing appliances for people to use in real-life situations.

If the KVM functionality isn't that important to you then this monitor might be excellent. However I've purchased a proper grown-up's KVM switch that will handle HDMI 2.0 as well as keyboard and mouse. Plus it can manage the audio out from the two computers as well, to go to a common sound system. Pity I've had to spend an extra hundred quid.

I'm also having trouble with the Auto-Pivot whereby you're supposed to be able to rotate the monitor to use it in Vertical/Portrait mode and have it automatically tell Windows. But it doesn't. But I'm still waiting on their technical people to suspend their disbelief long enough to provide me with a fix or a workaround. That's over a year I've been waiting. Meanwhile I just do it manually using the Windows Display Settings (right-click on an unoccupied bit of screen).

In the end the screen image quality is very good, Pity all the other functionality is so poor.",Helpful,4

Budget Monitor,"There's a one-star review on here from an Alan C and I swear I must have been sent the same monitor he returned! I've found the same list of problems he did in his review of the BenQ PD2700U that I received. The worst thing for me is the vignetting: dark, soft areas towards the edges, especially left and right. The uniformity is poor across the screen too, with a green tint towards the top left but a ""better"" white towards the bottom right. I agree with the reviewer that it's an extremely dull panel - I've got the brightness on full and it's just about useable.

So, either I've been given the same monitor that Alan C returned, or this is a recurring issue with these particular panels.

I've given it two stars because if you just want something to do a bit of browsing on or watch some Netflix etc. then it's decent enough. But it's completely unsuitable for the ""Graphic Design"" it claims to be for in its title.

For context, I've been running an animation and post-production business for over five years. It's a small business, I don't need to (and can't afford to) spend £2K on a monitor but I do need something that's fairly accurate. This is completely unsuitable for video production.

I may have been unlucky and just got a bad panel but I've wasted a few hours on this so it's being returned and I'll be looking at other brands instead of BenQ.

Was I expecting too much from a £450 monitor? Maybe. I'll try another in this price range and if I get the same issues I'll have to spend some more. But do please ignore the product name saying ""Monitor For Graphic Design"" - it's not good enough for even semi-professional work.

Good for household use or student purpose,Could of been good but has an unfortunate flaw,One,3
Satisfactory for the Price,"This monitor feels like a missed opportunity as there is a lot of things that it gets right:
* Build quality, although mostly plastic casing, is solid. The use of a clean black matt finish is also a nice addition. No annoying/tacky gloss.
* The colour accuracy (for sRGB/rec.709 at least - I did not really test the HDR), while not perfect is certainly good for the price.
* Built in light-sensor for automatic backlight adjustment.
* Fairly minimal IPS light bleed. There was some to begin with but letting the screen settle over a few days dramatically improved things here.
* While it doesn't state it in the specs, the monitor I received was compatible with AMD FreeSync between 40-60Hz. This might have just been the DisplayPort 1.4 ActiveSync as I didn't try it with HDMI.
* KVM Switch. A bit fiddly, but did allow easier switching between a Raspberry-Pi and workstation.
* Versatile and weighty stand with height, tilt, pivot and swivel adjustment.

This was shaping up to be just the monitor I needed. A jack of all trades for work, photo/video editing with some FreeSync 4K gaming on top. And here comes the fatal flaw.

This monitor has a problem with disappearing pixels.

When viewing the monitor from about 24-27 inches away with eye level centre of the screen, the left and right edges of the monitor are distorted and shadowed. Pixels at the very edge black out completely. The 2 photos attached demonstrate the issue. One looking straight at the edge with pixels present and one at about 30 degrees off axis. Moving around to have viewing angles greater than 45 degrees can cause the mouse and some small icons to nearly disappear!

Having some shadowing on the edges is normal with a lot of ""borderless"" designs. But completely disappearing pixels at such a narrow angle is strange. So I contacted BenQ Technical Support. They responded quickly and stated that this was expected behaviour for this type of panel and within specification.

This is very disappointing for a monitor that markets ""wide viewing angles"" and professional colour accuracy. It is an odd design decision. Therefore, I cannot recommend this monitor if you are going to be doing anything with it other than just photo editing or watching films/video (as these usually focus on the centre of the screen) which is a shame. Gaming looks overall very nice on this with the 4K + FreeSync; but when the hud at the side of screen starts disappearing because one changed their position slightly? This is not so great.",One,3

Without Edge Sharp Brightness Low Refresh Rate,"I bought this in late November 2018 through Amazon with a 3 year warranty when registered with Benq,by March this year (2020) I noticed a small amount of bleed in the bottom left corner, by September I had bleed at the bottom and top left hand side and a small amount starting in the top right hand side. At this point I contacted Amazon who passed me onto Benq customer services where they asked for photographs of the screen which I sent, they dually sent me a refurbished monitor.
I set this up the following day only to notice a vignetting affect, even when looking at the Google home screen it was very noticeable.
I replied to Benq within the 2 day acceptance period with photos of the screen to confirm the fault only to receive an email to tell me that this vignetting effect was within their limits and there was nothing else they could do!
I bought this monitor to edit photos, design CD covers and marketing literature as it was marketed as a professional designer monitor, with a screen that is so unevenly lit I have little confidence as to whether what I am actually seeing on the screen will be replicated when it is printed.
With 14 months of my warranty left I am beginning to think that the 3 year warranty given with this monitor was nothing more than a marketing ploy as was the description given to it ”Professional Designer monitor”.
If you are thinking of buying this monitor on its specifications and reviews then only believe the physical dimensions and ports available the rest is a figment of the manufacturers imagination, read the reviews of actual purchasers that have written the review 12 months after receiving it.
If you are considering parting with your hard earned cash for this monitor and you get one that is as it should be then you will enjoy working on it, as I did for 15 months.
Be sure to look at other buyers reviews of this monitor as there are several that have experienced the same problems as I have.
It used to be that when you said Benq your first thought was quality alas that has not been my experience over the last few months.

Lenovo L22e-20 Value for Money,"Returned due to poor brightness uniformity. Couldn't live with the obvious vignetting. Still waiting for a refund 4 days after it was delivered to Amazon.

Surprisingly, it didn't compare well to my 9 year old Dell U2412M.

Calibration found it to be 96% SGRB not the advertised 100%. Not sure if this is within acceptable tolerances.

Maybe just a bad example but has put me off BenQ monitors.",Helpful,3

Wrong information mentioned,"Premetto col dire che ho esperienza nel commentare prodotti legati al mondo dell'audiovisivo e che ho acquistato 3 di questi display (tutti inviati indietro tramite reso), quindi i difetti di cui parlerò non sono legati ad un modello specifico che mi è stato spedito.

Il problema è che, banalmente, il monitor è inferiore sotto quasi qualsiasi punto di vista a display dal prezzo simile come L'Asus ProArt PA279CV (tutto un altro pianeta).

La percezione, più che altro, è quella di uno schermo vecchio, con una selezione di porte discutibile (Display-Port, Mini-DisplayPort e HDMI); la costruzione oltretutto non ispira molta qualità e il monitor è abbastanza anonimo esteticamente.

La riproduzione dei colori è ottima (come però anche altri display dal prezzo simile), ma il display soffre di un fastidioso ronzio elettrico nella zona posteriore (che ispira poca difucia) e L'HDR è scadente, con una tendenza fastidiosa al magenta.
Come ciliegina sulla torta il display soffre di ""ritenzione dei pixel"", cioè un fenomeno dove dettagli luminosi di immagini ad alta frequenza di movimento rimangono sovraimpressi (come quando si scatta una polaroid) per diversi minuti.

Sicuramente agli albori dei display 4K HDR nel mondo PC questo monitor poteva essere uno dei migliori, e non è orribile in se, ma è improponibile (con la concorrenza attuale) venderlo vicino ai 500 euro.
Un display così, nel 2021, può essere venduto a 300 euro, non di più.

Good," I bought this for my work after lot of research and seeing great reviews though some user posted these issues I mentioned. I am facing permanent image retention(not a burn-in), flickering and lines. Even at the welcome screen without conneting any cable.

Bad color accuracy.,"I undertook quite a lot of research to decide on a monitor that would be ideal for my video editing, and looked at many reviews on YouTube. I decided in the end to go for the BenQ PD2700U, because it had received marvellous recommendations from professionals.

So the day it arrived, I opened the box, set the monitor up with the DP cable to my PC, and as soon as the screen appeared, I could instantly tell that something was very wrong.

The display had a dirty white, mottled appearance and it was obvious that there was a softening - darkening effect, that gave the appearance that the left and right edges to the screen were rounded / beveled. No matter how I adjusted the display, the picture quality seemed poor - basically dull looking, with the brightness set to 100% max.

This was not what I was expecting, and a quick look back through the video reviews, and I could see that the monitors displayed had bright and clear with no darkening on the sides (not like mine - dull and dreary!)

Yes - I accessed BenQ's website and completed the on-line customer inquiry form, but as yet nothing - no response, not even an acknowledgement of my email. I also telephoned their UK office and I think I was speaking to customer services, from another part of the world. He had suggested that I submit a photo of the problem, which I did. (See my photo's)

So, overall, I am very disappointed with this monitor, which received high praises from other people, and I hope that BenQ (if they do contact me), will confirm that I had received a faulty monitor.

Sorry BenQ - I have been making films for many years now, and I cannot work with this monitor, when I can clearly see that the fading picture quality is wrong . .

STOP PRESS: BenQ had responded and had offered to replace the monitor, which was very good of them - however, I have decided to arrange to return it to Amazon, and decide whether to buy it again, or look for an alternative make and model.",One,1
