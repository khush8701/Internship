       " \"Just got this laptop today, so based on just a few hours of usage.\\nEarlier using Lenovo Yoga 510 with touch and 360 degree rotation, but I havnt used these features much.\\n\\nNeeded a sturdy laptop, with latest specs, great display and for personal use, and as a backup if my office laptop dies on suddenly, but main purpose was entertainment, personal document work, photo editing as I am a photography enthusiast. Display was very important for me.\\n\\n(Update 17/9/21: There are ways to calibrate the display, built in the laptop itself, to some extent and this is awesome. I was able to tweak the display fairly close to printing colors, all ok now)-----This department still I feel a bit short on my expectation, as it has 100% sRGB and 2k resolution. Sure its crisp and bright and way better then any mainstream laptop display, but colors are not accurate(100% sRGB means it can display all the colors in that space, but it doesn't claim or deliver accurate display). There is a lot of difference between pics edited on this computer and the prints I take on my sRGB space printer, even more so than my previous 5 year old lenovo with Full HD IPS display. I would test this out more and update. So not a replacement of a proper color accurate display. On the other hand, colors do not feel as punchy for watching movies etc, but not a big deal for me. Display for any other task is good enough, very sharp and much brighter than other laptops in the market. I am not disappointed, but not impressed based on what my usage is.\\n\\nPlease bear in mind this is a special requirement, 99.99% people would be amazed with the display quality, as this was amazing for day to day usage. Just not for critical work, and for the price I dont think anything comes close.(see update above)\\n\\nAs far as other things go, performance, boot times, finger print, typing on keyboard, look and feel are all great. Seems sturdy, so should be good for a long time. This laptop is also not for gamers, as I feel performance for very heavy games and other tasks a little short, people need for video editing should spend some more for the i7 version or better assemble a desktop if mobility is not absolutely a necessity. Mine is i5 16gb which is good enough for me. Battery life is good for 8 hours of light work.\\n\\nOverall, for the price, and considering all metal build and performance it offers, this is a great buy. Just see your use case, take sometime to review your own requirements, and then consider. As a day to day laptop, I dont see anyone would find any shortcoming with this laptop. Its fine in all the departments.\",\n",

       " 'Happy with the product!!',\n",
       " \" This is the best laptop one can buy in this price range\\nI will divide this review into pros and cons.\\nCons: 1. It has a soldered ram so it would not be possible for the end user to upgrade it if you need more ram then you have to go for the 16 gb version .\\n2. Lack of an sd card reader.\\n3. The sound quality of the speaker is not that great.( It's not very loud .)\\nOther than that I couldn't find any other con in this device in the past 3 days of usage\\nPros: 1: Amazing display.This display is way better than realme notebook display .For comparison 2.5k vs 2k also it comes with 100%srgb so it's colour accurate.\\n2:Most devices in this price range(including realme notebook) come with the core i5 G7 series processor .But this one has the H series processor which was released in January .The H series processor has a better single core and multi core performance.Also the integrated iris xe graphics is great .\\n3:This device doesn't lag in day to day usage and does a good job in heavy tasks such as video editing .In my case while I was editing a video I didn't notice any lag and the fan also did not kick on.\\n4: Xiaomi claims 12 hrs of battery life but in real life usage for web browsing and online classes of about 2 hrs you will get 6 to 7 hrs of battery backup and for heavy tasks you can expect 4 to 5 hrs of battery backup.\\n5.This laptop has the best built quality in a laptop in this price rang .It's the same as a macbook pro .\\n6:Pre installed Ms office 2019 is amazing.\\n7:Backlit keyboard ,charging via thunderbolt and fingerprint scanner ,wifi 6 and a huge trackpad are just amazing.\\nThis laptop has everything a cse student needs.And I hope it lasts long. Also if you are planning to buy extended warranty then buy this laptop from mi.com with the extended warranty since the cost of extended warranty in their website and app is 3500 rps for 2 years.I bought it from Amazon so i had to buy the extended warranty seperately for which they charged me 5500 rps for 2years. Thank you.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not going to give you the specs or list down pros and cons. It's obvious now.\\n\\nThe thing I'm concerned is the price and it's worthiness.\\n\\nIs this budget friendly?\\nMaybe or maybe not.\\nIt cost me my dad's two month salary. Thanks to his early savings, we are not drowning.\\nSo in my case, it's not or to anyone who falling on bottom line of middle class. I picked this particular one after obsessively searching and evaluating the prices of different laptops over the span of last eleven months.\\n\\nInitially, I had my eyes on MSI Modern 14(Ryzen 4500u). Solid specs at that 49-54k price range. I hesitated because of the brand MSI(same can be said for MI but I will still choose it over MSI). Ram was 8gb, though I believe upgradeable but never made it clear. And then came the Windows 11 update and that model was not listed for the upgrade. So it gave me one more reason not opt to for it.\\n\\nAnother laptop, I might have bought, would have been Dell Inspiron 14 Ryzen 5500u, which was around 55k in the first month and when I finally decided to throw my money, they increased priced by 2 more thousands. I don't know what it's priced at now. Worth looking over, if you are ok with 45% ntsc display and ram is 8gb but ram is upgradeable.\\n\\nIf not this MI notebook, for now, I surely would have bought, Lenovo Thinkpad E14 AMD gen3. Fully upgradeable. Starting from around 53-55k. You can basically choose from screen to battery. Before buying it, don't forget to look for Lenovo coupon. They can give you discount up to 3k. If you don't find any, use LENGOD. I think it always works. Gives you an instant discount of 1500 rupees.\\n\\nSo, I still bought this MI notebook. I never bought any MI products and hate their buggy ad loaded phones. And worst, their previous year MI notebook.\\n\\nI bought this laptop because it looked very promising of all out there. So far(I have been using it for last 4 days), I did not feel like I burned my money for nothing. Except battery which is...meh and the keyboard worries me, because I'm not a delicate typist. I have always typed on cheap keyboards, so I type monstrously without much care.\\n\\nI would be using this laptop, mostly for programming. My tech stack is quite lightweight. React and Node(so far, it's been proved much snappier than my old computer). Though, I have planned to try Android next year. Other than that, I use chrome(which pretty easily eat up the ram), pdf reading, writing docs sometimes and nothing much fancier like video editing or gaming.\\n\\nIs this worth it?\\n\\nFor me, it's probably have been much worthier if they have given two year warranty. As MI is fairly new I laptop market and I have bought this laptop at a great risk.\\n\\nShould you buy this?\\nIf you can wait, then wait for few more months and do your research and keep yours eyes open. We don't know for how long will this laptop will last. That's only been my concern. Rest is good. Probably the best you can find in the market right now.\\n\\nI would update this review in upcoming months, if find any flaw or anything specific.\",\n",

       " ' I’m coming from a MacBook Pro that I use for work. I’m planning on starting my own business and wanted a laptop that could crush office work. These are my thoughts from 1 day on this laptop:\\n\\nScreen: Definitely a highlight of this device. Bright, Vivid and great contrast with deep blacks (deeper than my MacBook)\\n\\nSound: Nothing can beat Apple in terms of sound quality and loudness, this is still manageable if you are not in a noisy environment\\n\\nKeyboard: Very similar feel and travel compared to the MacBook, I’m able to type and hit combos with ease\\n\\nTrackpad: Responsiveness to touch us comparable to MacBook, but the click is really poor. It needs a huge amount of pressure compared to the MacBook\\n\\nPerformance: On Par with the MacBook in terms of heating and speed, haven’t noticed connectivity drops or flickering or intense heating. It does heat, but so do MacBooks running on Intel Chips\\n\\nWebcam: Another area where it absolutely outshines a MacBook Pro. It’s not the absolute best quality but it’s more manageable than what I have on my MacBook\\n\\nFinal Recommendation (will update as I find more): Great buy for productivity, but I would advise purchasing an additional mouse because the click is really bugging me',\n",

Don't go for 8GB, because after opening few chrome tabs and code editors my RAM was like 8GB occupied.

Despite of being light weight it feels solidly built. Plus the one finger lid open is cool.\\n3) Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are stable too.\\n4) Finger print recognition is on the power button (sensible design) and works quite well.\\n5) Good assortment of connectivity ports.\\n6) Efficient start-up time.\\n\\nCons:\\n1) Very poor speaker output, you will struggle to hear a word especially if you have a fan switch-on in the room. You would definitely require a external speaker for multimedia.\\n2) The track-pad is just not good. Not very accurate, unwanted gesture recognition and all in all irritating to work with. Ideally you would be using a external mouse for work.\\n3) The metal body does retain some static charge while charging. Although very minor but it still does.\\n\\nAcceptable:\\n1) The keyboard is decent enough for work. Although personally hate the miniaturized Up/Down arrows. Also not a fan of the positioning of the CTRL and Fn keys, frequently miss click them. Back-lighting is also good enough.\\n2) Battery charge last for a decent 6 hours in above moderate usage. Also doesn't get scorching hot ever on high utilization.\\n3) Decent value for money, not the best but good enough for under 60k with the i5+16gb version.\\n4) Web cam is not very good, but okayish for normal work calls.\",\n",
       " \"I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5.\\n\\nNow why 3.5 stars:\\n1. The edges to open lid with single hand are super sharp one can get easily scratched.\\n2. Super con - no grip. Seriously MI forgot to put grip below laptop. It doesn't stick to the table and slide like seesaw.\\n3. Speakers are poor\\n4. No camera shutter for privacy and yes camera is of poor quality doesn't even feel like 720p\\n5.

No idea about after sale service\\n8. 16:10 is just gimmick - ran Sheehan on amazon prime the video filled 50% portion of the screen and rest was black\\n\\nAfter using it for few days I feel this laptop 16GB+I5 is bit highly priced. It should be somewhere between 50-55k not more than that. Come on MI you are not a well established brand in laptop world like hp or dell, you should have atleast provided an aggressive pricing.\\n\\nSo to conclude it finally, if you can live with above cons go ahead and buy it. It will serve your purpose for next 4-5yrs\",\n",
       " 'So, let’s talk about good things first.\\n\\nDisplay: Yes, it has a QHD display in 16:10 aspect ratio (roughly, the actual ratio is bit less tall) and the display quality is really god at this range or even at range of 1.5 Lakhs. The screen is not exactly matte, but does good job of dimming down reflections. Still, not suggested to take it out in the sun as the nit count is low and the screen does reflect a bit.\\n\\nBuild quality: Real metal, not a finger print magnet. Solid construction, almost zero keyboard and screen flex. I have not dropped it yet, but, I am sure it can handle one or two low height drops (when lid is closed).\\n\\nKeyboard: Not Apple’s magic keyboard or a normal mechanical keyboard comfort, but the key travel is good and not a pain to type on. The keys are responsive and are easy to press due to to aforementioned zero flex chassis.\\n\\nSound: Almost all reviews I have seen of this laptop, along with a friend who bought this before me, complained that the speakers are trash and sound is really bad. However this is not the case. Sound is good in clarity and volume (for the price range), but since these are down firing speakers, they do get muffled for those people who place the laptop on bed, tummy or on some dining table with a table cloth. Of course, you cannot host a party with these speakers, but if you have normal environment with no loud noises around, you can rely on the speakers and enjoy music and movies. Also, please do not expect bass from laptop speakers.\\n\\nHeating: I did not encounter any heating issues with this laptop even when I tried to put some load on it. I avoid using the laptop for anything heavy due to battery issues, so could not test heating a lot.\\n\\nNow, onto the things which you should know before you regret buying this laptop:\\n\\nBattery: Absolutely pathetic. Takes forever to charge with the charger that comes with the unit and about 2 hours to go from 10% to 100% using a 65w USB ASUS USB C charger I have. Battery drain so quick that it surprises me. 100% to 10% in less than 5 hours with very minimal use - no games, no videos, just web browsing (some Youtube, but no other streaming). I also tried charging the laptop to 100% and just keep the display on and done nothing on it. Battery down to 8% in 5.5 hour.\\n\\nSize: It is a compact laptop, yes but it is big for a 14incher. This is because Xiaomi tried to be Apple and added big trackpad (which is not so responsive in the corners, so acts like a small trackpad anyway), and blank empty areas next to keyboard (which Apple uses for upward firing speakers). Using this on the lap or on the go is not difficult but a standard 14 inch laptop should be atleast 20% smaller than this. If I need big laptops, I can get a 15 inch screen on the same chassis.\\n\\nBluetooth: If anyone reading this ever had the original Mac Mini, you would know it had issues with Bluetooth connectivity due to all metal body. Same here. I have 4 wireless bluetooth headphones ranging from budget to premium ones. All of them has connectivity issues with this laptop. I tried connecting an external bluetooth dongle to the laptop, and that worked fine.\\n\\nI/O: I will not get into details, but do keep in mind that only 1 USB port allows for display out and HDMI is only 4K@30Hz. Also, the transfer speed is not same or stable on either of the USB-C Thunderbolt ports.\\n\\nGaming: LOL. Gaming at this price point with Intel Iris? Come on, stick to mobile gaming.',\n",
       " 'Going by specs sheet it appears wow...\\nBut things that should be considered which hampers your user experience:\\n1. Speaker output is useless and almost non existent under some normal scenerios like fan noise also\\n2. Quality of trackpad offered is just average...it is plastic and the buttons need to be pressed very hard which is non reassuring for long term use\\n3. The plastic used in connectivity ports gives less confidence while pluging and unplugging as it appears easily breakable\\n4. PD charger should have been offered instead of a generic one...you have to buy it from outside or carry around that brick cable with you\\n4. Software offered by MI is bearbone...dosnt feel a customised experience\\n5. Single fan can be a problem on heavly usage and the casing gets warm\\n6.

What it basically means is that in the BX500 (and in several other budget and premium SSDs), there\\'s a high-speed SLC cache and there\\'s MLC/TLC (ignore these terms). This card has TLC, which is very slow. So if you are moving 20 GB data to a 240 GB variant of the BX500 SSD from let\\'s say, another SSD, data transfer would be blazing fast for the first 16 GB (around 350-400 MB/s) and then it would slow down significantly (around 50-100 MB/s). For the 480 GB BX500, the SLC cache is of 32 GB, and it doubles with the next storage variants (64 GB SLC cache for 960 GB variant) as far as I know. Also, this SSD has a 3-year warranty and a fair endurance rating (check the product description on Crucial\\'s website).\\n\\nSo for whom is it SSD suitable? It\\'s for anyone who has used a laptop or a desktop before with a hard drive and now wants to use an SSD for better day-to-day speeds. It\\'s for everyone who wants to do basic things on their computer like browsing the web, checking and sending emails. If you want an SSD that is a high performance, for editing photos and videos, playing games, or if you plan on using the SSD as a scratch disk, check out the MX500 (that has a 5-year warranty and a higher endurance rating) or SSDs from Samsung.',\n",
       " ' At first look, it seems like a piece of plastic. Very light weight. We are habitual for hard disk as HARD (Strong) disk. Performance wise it is excellent. Superb speed.\\nPro. : easy to install, excellent boot speed,\\nlight weight, small and slim sized like as floppy disk size, transfer rate is 100 mbps to n fo ssd - hdd.\\nCons : very delicate (cautious while connecting and disconnecting), while installing win 10, take care of bios settings, old systems along with HDD bios settings sometimes disturbs.\\nOverall crucial is to notch in SSDs.',\n",

If you are in search of a SSD then simply go for this. And if you don't know how to replace you laptop's HDD with an SSD, then use the process shown by the crucial team. It's super easy to understand and follow.\",\n",
       " \"Are you worried about your aging laptop and thinking of replacing with a new one. Then please hold on to your thoughts for a minute. You can get a new system kind of feel if you just spend around 6000 rupees from your pocket. Yes, you don't have to spend 30/40 thousand rupees for a new one. You can clone your old HDD with cloning software's and just remove old HDD and fit new SSD and you are done. Yes , it is so simple to speed up your system even though it's is 10 years old. One condition here is there you have to increase your RAM to 8 GB to get the full potential of your system\\nAfter doing all this you won't regret your decision.\",\n",
       " \"I have purchased Crucial 240GB SSD twice. The first one I purchased in Aug 2020. I can surely say that the performance of my laptop just had a J-curve. My laptop became so fast that I don't need to wait for anything.\\n\\nLet me just tell you, my uses. I work in Chrome (the most with more than 20 tabs at the same time), Adobe Photoshop (sometimes), Adobe Illustrator (sometimes), Spotify, MS Office and some small apps. While coming to gaming I was playing games initially but not now. I completed the below list of games after installing SSD:\\n* Tomb Raider (2013) - Run flawlessly\\n* Rise of Tomb Raider - Run smoothly in the low setting with 1080p, and high setting with 720p\\n* Assassins Creed (I don't remember the part, but definitely not the old one, the graphics were good and was able to play in high setting in 1080p)\\n* Just Cause 3 (Worked well in Medium Settings)\\n* 2 more games which I don't remember the name of them.\\n\\nWell, the use of SSD in gaming is reducing the startup time game and smooth transition while playing the game. I guess this SSD does that very well. I also want to highlight a point; my laptop has an I5 8th gen processor with an AMD graphics card and 8GB ram. So, the performance also depends on the other factors too, not SSD alone.\\n\\nImportant Note:\\nThe second SSD which I purchased now, I installed in my old laptop which is around 8 years old with a very outdated processor and 4GB ram. This laptop gets slow if I update Windows 10 to the latest version and the cursor just stucks while moving. After installing SSD also, I was unable to update Windows 10 latest version, I have to use the 2019 version of Windows 10 and have to disable the auto-updates. The smoothness improved, but again high-end software or games can't be played. It's not the SSD's fault, it has other factors too.\",\n",
       " \"This is useful for those who have a traditional hard disk and are frustrated by its speed (or lack of it 😄).\\nMy HP pavilion 15 is 4 years old with 12GB RAM i5 and Windows 10. But the boot up time was around 2.5 minutes. Also I use Adobe softwares a lot (photoshop, Lightroom, premier Pro, After effect) and some of these softwares would take minutes to start. Now my laptop takes around 25 seconds to boot up (Yours could be less). Adobe Software's load time reduced to seconds.\\n\\nWho should buy this SSD?\\n1. For beginners, who just want to give their PC a boost with a low budget.\\n2. For older PC'S AND LAPTOPS. It's self explanatory. Older computers have older hardware and just by upgrading to high speed storage it's not going to make much of a difference. So settle down for a cheaper one.\\n3. If you are not a heavy user.\\n\\nIf you have a budget then always go for SSD with DRAM like MX500 or Samsung EVO. There is no doubt that it would be considerably faster than these DRAM LESS SSD.\\n\\nHope it was helpful\",\n",

I was planning to upgrade my RAM from 4GB to 8GB as well; but the speed of this SSD could counter-balance the functional speed. I'm still planning to upgrade the RAM, but this SSD has served my purpose so far.\\n\\nVisual Studio .Net and Video Editing packages like Filmora is working really good with this SSD. The lag is very less and it's only because of the lack of RAM, which I counter-act by not opening too many applications at once. The response speed of the SSD is good. I've not used SSDs from other companies so not sure how good it is compared with others. Just to mention, the Android Studio is still not as functional & smooth with this SSD.\\n\\nIf you're a gamer, this SSD may disappoint you.

       " \"Used in Lenovo g50-70 laptop and could clearly feel the speed after changing from HDD to SSD. But this was only for 40 days. After this Windows freezes often and disk usage is always at 100%. Read speed is still about 500MB/s, but write speed drastically reduced to about 10MB/s. It is now performing worse than HDD. Tried enabling over-provisioning, momentum cache, force garbage collection and all windows optimizations, but nothing worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of taking it to service center without any hope. Very disappointed with the product. All positive reviews seems to be only initial feelings. It is not a good product in the long run.\\n\\nEdit:\\nI didn't have to go to service center. I searched the web a lot and found this solution for the slowness issue. I found that this is a known SSD performance degradation after a lot of writes to it. When I checked the Total Bytes Written (TBW) with CrystalDiskInfo it was 1.3TB. This was within 40 days of purchase. There were a lot of writes happening as my RAM was low and the OS was writing a lot to the page file in SSD. First I increased my RAM to avoid this and to restore my SSD write performance to its original state I did something called ATA Secure Erase. After this, it was as fast as when it was new. I did it using a terminal in live boot of linuxmint which is a bit tricky. You can search the web on how to perform ATA Secure Erase.\\n\\nMy general recommendations to avoid this issue:\\n1. Leave about 10% of the space as unallocated. It is called over-provisioning which is used by the SSD controller for TRIM/garbage collection.\\n2. Install Crucial Storage Executive and switch on momentum cache (if you have a power backup. A laptop will anyway have battery). You can search for more details about these online.\\n3. Upgrade your RAM so that you won't use page file much because of low memory.\\n4. Instead of cloning the present HDD with OS, it is better to install OS freshly on SSD. I think the TRIM commands that are sent by the OS to the SSD might not have happened correctly because of the cloning. While installing OS freshly on SSD all the settings will be chosen correctly by the OS.\\n\\nAll these are a hassle for a normal user and I don't recommend the product overall. Some say Crucial MX500 model is good as it has a DRAM cache which is very useful. Rs. 1000 more for better life and performance of SSD is worth it.\\n\\nAnother suggestion is to use a HDD caddy for second hard drive and write your media files to it, so that SSD is only used for OS and minimize the writes to SSD, thus prolonging its life. The endurance mentioned for this drive in their website is TBW of about 120TB.\",\n",

In older games like battlefield 1, GTA 5, Metro Redux, etc you can crank the settings to ultra and the fps will remain at 60fps.\\n2. The Ryzen 5 5600H is a beast of a processor and can handle anything that you can throw at it.\\n3. The 70 watt hour battery (compared to the 50 watt hour that you will find in other laptops) easily gives around 6hrs of normal use e.g. browsing, youtube, video playback, a bit of photoshop etc. while the other laptops in the price segment can hardly manage 4hrs.\\n4. The build quality is amazing. Its made for people, like students who need a daily driver laptop which can game and at the same time does not look too flashy. Its functional, the keyboard is good, mousepad feels good to use and the overall build quality is great.\\n5. Viewing angles are great, no glare or reflections as it is a matt finish screen.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. The fan intake vents are on either sides of the laptop. So if you are using the laptop, keeping it on your lap, the fan intakes will get blocked. You will have to keep a hard, flat base underneath in order to prevent the intakes from getting blocked.\\n2. The laptop is a bit heavy and if you are thinking of keeping it on your lap and using it, good luck. Your legs are going to go numb in a very short time.\\n3. The screen does not get very bright. So it will be difficult to use it outside, under direct sunlight.\\n\\n*Note:\\nIn many online reviews you will find complains about screen wobbling, but the issue is not as much as they are making it to be. The screen has a normal amount of wobble which you will find in most other similar sized laptops.\\n\\nAnd if you are looking for a laptop for gaming only, don't buy this. Rather go for something with a 3050. This is good for casual gaming (it can run all games but you'll have to compromise on the graphics a bit) but not for playing all games at maxed settings and streaming at the same time.\\n\\nI've run the following games on this laptop and all of them work great:\\nDays Gone\\nNFS Heat\\nGTA 5\\nBattlefield 1\\nMetro Redux\\nDishonored 1 & 2\",\n",
       " \" Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.\\n\\nedit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.\\n\\nInitially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop as cool as possible.\\n\\nI like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner.\\n\\nI re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity. For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.\\n\\nHP factory setting for this laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.\\n\\nWith this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.\\n\\nFor experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again. So I used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.\\n\\nLaptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .\\n\\nThe Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500m\\n\\nAlso recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience. I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.\\n\\nedit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.\\n\\nedit2:\\nDue to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick.\",\n",

I tried to activate all three profiles to save, it doesn't work, the 4th profile on the controller doesn't even load.

For those who have made it work, kudos to them, but this definitely has a lot of issues and is something I will not recommend buying.\\n\\nHowever, as I noted above, good job to the makers for trying to offer such a vast variety of customisation on a mobile compatible controller, including setting up your own scripts to run a command and many more at a decent price.

But I am yet to experience how they go about. Having said this, the ergonomics of the product is not very good as the lowest tilt angle it offers is also too high while using it placed on your work desk and that's where most of us will be using this product on. It should offer a low tilt so that the ventilation can happen beneath the surface without giving stress to neck. It offers you a placement angle of minimum 45degrees to 60 degrees. I think it should have offered a 15-20 degree angle to serve the ventilation purpose.\\n\\nP.S: I bought this product for 599 after waiting for a long time and seeing quite higher prices upto 1499.

The gap can be reduced if I position the stand at it's lowest position but there's still gap which means the triangular foam pads in the center of the base plate never touch the laptop. At the position I've set it on, the foam pads on the bottom are also barely touching the laptop as you can see in the image.\\n\\nThe whole laptop is prevented from sliding by a lip at the end of the frame which maintains the most contact with the laptop and should have the foam pads instead. This lip should also have a cut in the center to lift the lid up as in my case, I've to lift the Mac up to open it as there's no gap to open it. Then, I've to lift the laptop again when closing it as the lid touches the lip instead of closing completely.\\n\\nThe conclusion of this design flaw is that it's not a one hand easy task to open it and you've to be careful everytime you close or open it so to not damage the laptop.

The leg sturdiness is excellent, the table won't shake or wobble while writing on it. The table top side finishing is also excellent. The other slight problem is of that slider drawer, it is not that consistently smooth and neither of good quality.

The drawer is adequate and can hold stationery and other knick-knacks. I find the handle quite useful as it's easy to carry the table with one hand. The only issue I find with the table is that it's wobbly because of its rounded legs. I use it on my bed, so I have to place the laptop in such a way that the table doesn't tip over. The mobile holder is quite useless. Its cord is inflexible and it's difficult to place the phone in an orientation of your choice.

The macbook/phone holder is also a great addition which helps to place your device safely. The coffee cup holder may be useful, however I found it redundant.\\n\\nThe space provided could have been a bit larger. If this table is bought for official work while using a laptop or as a breakfast table for patients, the space is enough. However as a study table, with many books and notebooks to keep, the space should have been a bit more. Maybe, if you do not keep a coffee cup on the table and utilise the space judiciously, it can serve the purpose.\\n\\nOverall, it's an ergonomic product, with an appealing look. The only drawback that I found was the stability. When writing on the notebook, the base of this table shakes a bit, which can disrupt the work. Whether it's placed on the bed or on the floor, the case is same. The constant vibratory movements might lead to bad handwriting. I would have liked it better if the footing was more stable and didn't shake. Also, it could have been a bit higher or atleast the height should have been adjustable.\\n\\nOverall, it's good to go and can be considered if you are looking for a good looking foldable table at a reasonable price.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\",\n",

So basically i use\\n\\nI have the mixed black and white army type colour which gives a fantastic look.\\n\\nIf you are a pure gamer consider the MERITS first in the next paragraph.\\n\\nDEMERITS:\\nPersonally i am satisfied but i will first mention the drawbacks.\\nSound is very loud, i mean u can hear the sound from even 10 meters away so the question is, is it a headphone or a speaker. I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.\\n\\nMERITS:\\nNow lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).\\nThe best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion.

       " \"I am using Sony Headphones for over 2 years now, which were sufficiently good for me. They got damaged somehow, and new sony wireless headphones costed a whole lot than this headphone so I would've had to buy the wired ones, so went for boat. So I'll be comparing these with Sony wired headphones in the same price range (<2000) (believe me, I've used all variants/models)\\n\\nPros:\\n1. The look: The Black ones that I bought look sick. Fallen in love. If you're a black lover like me, go for boat rockerz 450 instead of 510!🖤\\n\\n2. Bluetooth: it works crisp. I get range in my whole room and even when I keep the phone in my room and go into another room. Excellent.\\n\\n3. Price: I got them at ₹1199 at Republic Day sale 2020. Worth it.\\n\\n4. Aux cable: They provided me the aux cable. Everybody has confusion whether they'll provide or not, but they did to me.\\n\\n5. Sound Quality : Decent. Nice bass. If you have been using earphones, you'll love these headphones.\\n\\n6. Noise cancellation: My Sony ones didn't have noise cancellation but these do, and it's awesome.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. I've been using Sony and the sound quality of Sony is better than this.\\n\\n2. Bass of the sony headphones was way better than these. Believe me these are not at all bad(you'll love them) but if you are coming from Sony or JBL, you'll get a bit disappointed.\\n3. Latency: If you want to play games with this headphones, you will have to use the AUX cable to do that. Can't play games wireless ly, because the game sound will lag too much, making them unpalatable. I tried PUBG, free fire, call of duty, etc. Nearly all of them. But I'm fine with it really, because when you play games on your phone your phone is in your hand anyway, so use the damn aux cable.\\nConclusion: I was getting JBL ones for ₹1999 but didn't go for them because they didn't have aux support. Sony wireless headphones do have it, but they cost a lot more (4000 atleast) so couldn't buy them as well.\\nIf you are ok with spending ₹4000 go with Sony. If you don't really need an aux cable support go with JBL. If you are ok with wired headphones go with Sony wired as they are in the same price range as these.\\n\\nSo at this price range, these are literally the best wireless headphones you can buy. If this is your budget, go for it.\\nI find these sexier than boat rockerz 510 but I'm a black lover and this is my opinion.\\nIf you found this review helpful, hit a thumbs up and help others.\",\n",
       " \"⚫ SOUND QUALITY - Sound quality is amazing for this price and Virtualization is good .\\n⚫ BASS - Average bass not so good or bad, it lies in the middle .\\n⚫ COMFORT - Not so comfortable , but it is better than boat rockerz 400 , The ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 .\\n⚫ CONNECTIVITY - Connecting faster to devices . Range is very good , i didn't face any connectivity loss upto 10m and also it has dual pairing feature . There is an audio latency when playing games and No audio latency when watching videos .\\n⚫ CONTROLS - It is very easy to control and They have kept multifunctional or integrated controls ( Refer to the booklet provided inside the box ) .\\n⚫ MICROPHONE - Mic is good, Not as bad as boat rockerz 400 .\\n⚫ NOISE CANCELLATION - They have used passive noice cancellation , It doesn't not seems to reduce any outside unwanted ambient noises.\\n⚫ BATTERY - Standby time is amazing as mentioned by the Boat , Charging time takes upto 2 hrs 30 mins .\\n⚫ BUILD QUALITY AND MATERIAL - They have used good plastic material but the slider for adjusting the size of the headphones is not good , the wire gets popped out when sliding . Pls be careful when sliding . The ear cups and headband cushion is soft and sweat proof , the water gets easily evaporated.\\n⚫ DESIGN - It features an on-ear design and the ear cups are bigger than boat rockerz 400 . It is light-weight but not a sturdy design , which is not intended for jogging or running purposes . For gym it can be used to do strength or weight training or weight lifiting workouts not for aerobic or cardio workouts . The folding design is amazing for the safety of the headphones , it can be easily folded which is easy to place on the flat surfaces .\\n⚫ LOOK - Premium look with matte black finish , looks sexy when wearing the headphones .\\n\\n◼️ VERDICT : Waited for a long time to get a good wireless heaphone with premium look and design. You will never get a premium look headphone with hd sound & nice battery backup at this price segment , Overall a great value for money .\",\n",

I would say to wait for its price to drop from 1499/- to 999/- cause i feel this product is not worth more than 999/-. Its bass is pretty good for 999. But its not earth shaking bass.. Average bass.. But best, no not best, i would say top notch sound quality. Very good product from boat. Value for money only 999/- then. But i dont think this is a durable product only because the plastic in it's adjustable head band part is of cheap quality unlike its body. Its body is made up of high quality smooth matt finish plastic and some parts rade of rubber like material. Not comfortable for movies. Ears pain if worn for more than 1 hour. Ear cushion and head band padding is adequate not astonishing but. But its just worth 999 so cant except much. Battery life is as said, 15hours. I watched a movie of 3hours and only 20% of battery got used. Charges in about 2-3 hours. But it is very small, not suitable for people with big heads, (not 🤓 nerds) 😂...Aux cable is cheap quality n very thin but sound quality is good, usb cable is very cheap quality, i dont even use it,Aux cable length is 150 cms and usb cable is 80cms in length. Very dissapointed but as the seals of the box were tampered. 😡😡😡😡😡😡Very bad seller approach. Maybe he opened them and listened a song and when he got bored he packed it and sent to me😑😏😏. Buy from flipkart instead and avoid tampered products. I kept cause i needed it urgently and it was fine without any physical damge or mechanical errors. Finally i would say. Go for it folks.

The bass feels very low, it's not at all punchy according to the price point. The mids and highs are good but the sound coming out of it is not pleasant to the ears, if you've used any premium pair of headphones then you will definitely gonna feel it. Other than this, Bluetooth works excellently and additional aux input is also very convenient. Coming to comfort, you'll be fine if you're using it for 1-2 hours, but after that, you'll start feeling pain in your ears. The padding on the headband is good and quite comfortable.\\n\\nFinal verdict: These are good headphones for an average user, can be used for calling and gaming purposes (especially for PUBG 😀) but you might feel discomfort after using it continuously for more than 2 hours, Bluetooth works flawlessly, but if you're a serious music listener or bass lover then these are definitely not for you.\\n\\nWhat's included in my box: Headphones, Micro USB Charging Cable, Auxillary Cable, User Manual and Warranty Card.\\n\\nEdit: After 3 months of usage the headphones plastic broke and the cups got losen.

Packaging is good for the first time\\n2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.\\n3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.\\n4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.\\n5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.\\n6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.\\n7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .\\n9. Battery life is just as advertised\\n8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k for sure.\\n\\nCons\\n1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.\\n2. It's not as loud as I want it to be\\n3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.\\n4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat\\n5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good\",\n",

And my 4 year old XB 450 I'd miles better still. ASTOUNDING. SHOCKING, how these sell so much.\\n\\nMillions of marketing budget and good looks, I guess. This works better as a fashion accessory than a pair of wireless headphones. The only saving grace is the Aux cable. Somehow the sound is slightly better plugged in. From bad to just poor.\\n\\nMy suggestion: don't buy it. Don't fall for the made in India BS.. It's not. It looks a lot like a Blaupunkt model, with slight variations.

       " \"The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.\\n\\n1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.\\n2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.\\n3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.\\n5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.\\n4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?\\n1 Build\",\n",

I used it with the broken handle, very soon the mic stopped working and I claimed my warranty since it was active.

I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.\\n\\nMERITS:\\nNow lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).\\nThe best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion.

I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.\\n\\nMERITS:\\nNow lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).\\nThe best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion.

I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.\\n\\nMERITS:\\nNow lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).\\nThe best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion.

I will mainly point out the noise cancellation, even noise cancellation is okay but u cant have a moment of privacy with these headphones its too loud that your neighbors will listen everything very clearly whatever u are listening to. Another demerit is it doesnt have a call receiving/play/pause button. Another demerit i felt, it doesnt feel so comfortable to wear it while sleeping.\\n\\nMERITS:\\nNow lets come to the things i liked about it, i will say again i love the looks, it just looks like a crown on your head. Its heavy but the padding is great you will not feel the weight, its just feels nice. The cables i will surely praise they are around more than 2 meters and they are so strong, the build quality of the cable is like the quality of the electric irons, i mean literally i m not kidding. I will recommend this for every pc gamers as this have a very long cable, a volume control with it and even a switch for the mic on/off(quite useless for me).\\nThe best benefit u get with this is that u are getting a speaker free with this😜 feeling heavy, irritated on ears, volume it up and just keep it on ur table (just kidding🤣). Lets ge back it is very comfortable to wear for as long as you want. And the only reason i like it over boat bassheads 900 is the confortness and the sorround sound. If u will listen to 8d sounds u will think that the boat bassheads 900 is more clear about the sound directions but while playing i get the loaction way much better with this headphone, not sure but its kind of a illusion.

       " \" Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.\\n1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch\\n2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.\\n3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.\\n4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.\\n5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.\\n6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.\\n7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.\\n8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.\\n9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.\\n10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.\\n11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.\\n12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.\\n\\nTIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________\\n\\n1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.\\n\\n2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately\\n3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.\\n4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.\\n\\nFew other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :\\n1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.\\n2) Remote shutter button for camera.\\n3) Call silencing option could have been added.\",\n",

       " 'Overall product is good but one major disadvantage is Connectivity issue.Blutooth connection is not so strong.If you want SMS ,Mails and phone contacts updates on Watch you have to open their app in background continuously ones you clear your phone ram memory immediately watch got disconnection after that you will not get alerts on your watch not for Anything.If you want alerts again then you have to open the app.\\n\\n01 Blutooth connection lots is the biggest disadvantage\\n02 You can not get whats app notification alert on watch.\\n03 Battery Life is only 2 days maximum with full load like Heart rate monitoring, Stress monitoring,',\n",
       " \"All though I don't like the product it does a some pros\\n\\nThe watch has alexa so you can control your smart devices but only if you are near your phone.\\nLooks good, display is good... Good for normal use\\n\\nCons:\\nApp based GPS tracking doesn't work properly, doesn't give proper mileage covered nor gives proper cal burnt.\\nAnd most worst is the Google fit sink. The app keeps on added the total every time it start syncing for eg. If you have burnt 100 cal ( from 9am to 10am) and ( between 10 to 11 no activities) thn during 11 am to 12 pm if you burn another 100 cal the synced Google fir cal burnt will be 300 because the app sent the 100 call for 10am thn it goes and sync again with total cal burnt at 12pm again which 200cal.... Such a huge bug...\",\n",
       " \"Looks good, shows time, not very light, tracks steps but UI is not up to the mark. Good brightness and allows setting user photo wallpaper. If you can't afford the Apple Watch but want something on your wrist that looks like one, get it. If you want the experience of a smartwatch, this is nowhere close.\",\n",
       " 'The watch for girls is way too clumsy with cheap touch and feel and cheap plastics. The display itself is ok but the 2 second display is a no go. Worst thing is that the unit is offered with many different Sport to measure but it can only document time not meter or waypoints. Specially as it is offered for swimming were you want to know you time and distance to measure your performance. This is just a posh fake - a watch not more. Useless for sports and performance even the steps are counted wrongly. Better to invest in a Garmin or Apple Watch. Will send it back immediately. Amazon should not promote such rubbish.',\n",
       " \"It is just impossible to rotate wrist and look at display as the display turns off and on at it's own wish.\\n\\nWhile operating the watch, the display can turn off at it's own with as it thinks you may have rested ur wrist.\\n\\nI didn't trust the BPM and sleep reading this is showing.\\n\\nThe flash light is dim and it's menu is very deep.\\n\\nAlexa integration is just to overcharge customer.\\n\\nI also bought a cheap smartwatch worth 600rs along with this and that is better although it lacks rich touch screen navigation.\",\n",
       " 'What I liked :\\nBeautiful design\\nLight weight\\nSteps and bp measurements were good\\n\\nWhat I don’t like :\\nAlexa won’t speak but just take long time to “ think” and print result ok screen ..\\nEven if you ask “ Alexa what is the time now” it will take a few seconds and prints “ thinking” on the screen and then prints the actual response on screen ..:\\n- Experienced lag between swipes',\n",

I got this product on 9th July.\\n\\non 21st, its display automatically turned into green lines. after 2 hours, it itself gets working. on 25th, again the same issue happened.
